## Author Voice & Personality

Xavier's natural communication style (based on Insights Discovery profile: Type 26 - Motivating Inspirer). Use this to ensure content sounds authentic.

### Natural Strengths to Lean Into

| Trait | How It Shows in Content |
|-------|------------------------|
| Big-picture thinker | Lead with strategic insight, not granular how-tos |
| Story-driven | Personal anecdotes and real examples resonate |
| Energetic and enthusiastic | Content should feel alive, not dry or academic |
| Democratic, involves others | Invite dialogue; use "you" language; ask questions |
| Quick to see possibilities | Contrarian takes and "what if" thinking |
| Warm and empathetic | Acknowledge reader struggles before solving them |

### Voice Signatures

**Sounds like Xavier:**
- "Here's what actually works..."
- "Most people get this wrong because..."
- "I made this mistake at [company]—here's what I learned"
- "The uncomfortable truth is..."
- Direct opinions, stated confidently
- Frameworks and mental models over abstract theory
- Humour where appropriate (not forced)

**Doesn't sound like Xavier:**
- Overly hedged statements ("it could potentially perhaps...")
- Dense, detail-heavy explainers without a clear point
- Formal, distant, corporate tone
- Content that reads like a textbook
- Excessive caveats or disclaimers

### Tendencies to Watch

| Natural Tendency | Content Implication |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Prefers verbal over written | Best ideas may come from spoken notes—capture and refine |
| Bored by detail | Ensure important specifics aren't glossed over |
| Starts many things | Series and multi-part content need deliberate completion |
| Can exaggerate significance | Check claims are grounded and defensible |
| Values opinions over pure facts | Balance conviction with evidence |

### Communication Preferences (for editorial feedback)

When reviewing Xavier's content or suggesting edits:
- Be direct—don't bury feedback in qualifications
- Focus on the "so what?"—does this land?
- Recognise what's working before noting issues
- Keep it lively, not dull or procedural

## Words to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| leverage | use |
| utilise | use |
| synergy | (just describe the benefit) |
| stakeholder alignment | agreement, buy-in |
| deep dive | detailed look, analysis |
| unpack | explain |
| circle back | follow up |
| learnings | lessons |
| impactful | effective, useful |
| holistic | complete, full |

## Authenticity Rules

### Case Studies

**Only include case studies when:**
1. The idea file explicitly mentions a real case study to use, OR
2. You frame it as clearly hypothetical

**Real case studies:**
- Must be based on actual experience provided by the author
- Can be anonymised ("a Series B fintech" not "Company X")
- Include specific, verifiable details

**Hypothetical examples:**
- Frame clearly: "Consider a scenario where..." or "Imagine a CTO who..."
- Keep brief — illustrate the point, don't fabricate a narrative
- Never present hypotheticals as real experiences

**When in doubt:**
- Leave a placeholder: `[CASE STUDY: Real example needed - theme: X]`
- The author will fill in from actual experience

### Personal Experience

- Only reference personal experience explicitly provided in the idea file
- Don't invent backstory or fake "I once worked with..." anecdotes
- Use "I've seen teams..." only when grounded in real observation
