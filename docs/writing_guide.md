## Voice & Tone

### Core Attributes

- **British English** — colour, optimise, realise, whilst, amongst
- **Direct and concise** — no waffle, get to the point
- **Structured** — clear sections, numbered lists, tables where helpful
- **Professional but approachable** — expertise without arrogance
- **Dry wit** — occasional, understated, never forced
- **Action-oriented** — ranked recommendations, clear next steps
- **Multiple perspectives** — acknowledge trade-offs and context

### More Of

- Specific examples and numbers
- Personal failures and lessons (real ones)
- Contrarian but well-supported opinions
- Practical templates and frameworks
- "Here's what I'd actually do" recommendations

### Less Of

- Abstract theorising
- Obvious advice everyone gives
- Lengthy disclaimers and caveats
- Generic industry commentary
- Consultant-speak ("leverage", "synergy", "stakeholder alignment")
- Filler words and hedging ("I think", "perhaps", "it seems")

### Words to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| leverage | use |
| utilise | use |
| synergy | (just describe the benefit) |
| stakeholder alignment | agreement, buy-in |
| deep dive | detailed look, analysis |
| unpack | explain |
| circle back | follow up |
| learnings | lessons |
| impactful | effective, useful |
| holistic | complete, full |

## Authenticity Rules

### Case Studies

**Only include case studies when:**
1. The idea-builder prompt explicitly mentions a real case study to use, OR
2. You frame it as clearly hypothetical

**Real case studies:**
- Must be based on actual experience provided by the author
- Can be anonymised ("a Series B fintech" not "Company X")
- Include specific, verifiable details

**Hypothetical examples:**
- Frame clearly: "Consider a scenario where..." or "Imagine a CTO who..."
- Keep brief — illustrate the point, don't fabricate a narrative
- Never present hypotheticals as real experiences

**When in doubt:**
- Leave a placeholder: `[CASE STUDY: Real example needed - theme: X]`
- The author will fill in from actual experience

### Personal Experience

- Only reference personal experience explicitly provided in the idea file
- Don't invent backstory or fake "I once worked with..." anecdotes
- Use "I've seen teams..." only when grounded in real observation

## Content Length by Channel

### Blog Posts (Ghost)

| Content Type | Word Count | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| Framework/how-to | 1,500–2,000 | Sweet spot for lead generation |
| Thought leadership | 1,800–2,200 | Authority building, SEO value |
| Case study deep-dive | 2,000–2,500 | Only when real case study exists |
| Opinion/hot take | 800–1,200 | Punchy, focused argument |

**Default target: 1,500–1,800 words**

Structure for readability:
- Clear H2/H3 hierarchy
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Bold key phrases for skimming

### LinkedIn Posts

| Metric | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Optimal length | 1,200–1,800 characters |
| First line (hook) | Under 140 characters (before "See more") |
| Maximum | 2,000 characters (engagement drops beyond this) |
| Minimum | 500 characters (algorithm penalises shorter) |

**Structure:**
- Hook in first line — must compel the click
- One idea per post
- White space between paragraphs
- End with question or clear CTA
- No hashtag stuffing (3 max, at end if any)

### Newsletter (Jungle Brief)

| Section | Length |
|---------|--------|
| Deep insight | 400–600 words |
| Template/tool intro | 200–300 words |
| Curated link commentary | 50–100 words each |
| Total issue | 800–1,200 words |
