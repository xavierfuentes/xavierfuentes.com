# Blog SEO Guidelines

## Primary Keywords (High Intent)

- "fractional CTO services"
- "startup technology strategy"
- "engineering team scaling"
- "technical due diligence"

## Secondary Keywords (Thought Leadership)

- "technology leadership frameworks"
- "startup CTO responsibilities"
- "engineering management best practices"
- "technical debt strategy"

## On-Page SEO

### Title
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Keep under 60 characters
- Make it compelling, not just keyword-stuffed

### Meta Description
- 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword
- Compelling hook that encourages click
- End with implicit or explicit CTA

**Example:**
```
Most CTOs treat technical debt like it's optional. Here's the framework I use to make it a strategic asset—and get buy-in from the board.
```

### First Paragraph
- Include primary keyword in first 100 words
- Hook the reader immediately
- Set up the problem or contrarian take

### Headings
- Use H2 for main sections
- Use H3 for subsections
- Include secondary keywords naturally
- Make headings scannable and informative

### Internal Links
- Link to 2-3 related posts where relevant
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Link to pillar content where appropriate

## Frontmatter SEO Fields
