# Blog Voice & Tone

- **Structured and scannable** - Clear headers, bullets, short paragraphs
- **Direct** - Get to the point, no waffle
- **Practical** - Actionable frameworks, not abstract theory
- **British English** - colour, optimise, realise, whilst, amongst

## More Of

- Specific examples with numbers ("reduced deploy time from 45 to 12 minutes")
- Personal failures and lessons learned
- Contrarian but well-supported opinions
- Practical templates and frameworks
- "Here's what I'd actually do" recommendations

## Words to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| leverage | use |
| utilise | use |
| synergy | (describe the benefit) |
| stakeholder alignment | agreement, buy-in |
| deep dive | detailed look, analysis |
| unpack | explain |
| circle back | follow up |
| learnings | lessons |
| impactful | effective, useful |
| holistic | complete, full |

## Formality Level

More formal than LinkedIn, but not academic. Write like you're explaining to a peer CTO over coffee - knowledgeable, direct, occasionally wry.
