## Tracking Distribution

When reviewing the pipeline:

1. Count ideas by pillar (all statuses except `archived`)
2. Calculate percentage vs targets
3. Flag pillars that are:
   - Over by >10%: Pause new ideas in this pillar
   - Under by >10%: Prioritise ideation here

## Rebalancing Strategy

If distribution is off:

- **technology-strategy over:** Wait; it's the core pillar
- **leadership-management under:** Draw from recent team experiences
- **execution-delivery under:** Mine past projects for process learnings
- **founder-lessons under:** Schedule reflection time; personal stories need headspace
- **market-ai-trends over:** Reduce; this pillar ages fastest
