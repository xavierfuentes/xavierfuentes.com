# First 90 Days as a Technical Leader

A restraint-first checklist for CTOs, engineering managers, and technical founders stepping into new leadership roles.

## Weeks 1-4: Deep Listening

Your only job in the first month is to understand. Not to form conclusions. Not to identify problems. Just to absorb.

- [ ] Schedule 1:1s with every direct report
- [ ] Go one level deeper — meet skip-level reports
- [ ] Shadow key meetings without contributing
- [ ] Announce explicitly: "I'm here to learn, not to judge"
- [ ] Read architecture documents and post-mortems
- [ ] Review strategy decks and roadmaps
- [ ] Explore Slack/Teams history for team dynamics
- [ ] Ask open questions: "What's working well?"
- [ ] Ask: "What would you change if you could?"
- [ ] Ask: "What do I need to understand about this team's history?"

::: tip
The moment you start offering opinions, people stop telling you the truth and start performing for the new boss.

## Weeks 5-8: Mapping the Landscape

Now you can start forming a picture. But keep it internal.

- [ ] Identify what's actually working (there's always more than you think)
- [ ] Note genuine pain points vs. surface complaints
- [ ] Understand constraints that shaped current decisions
- [ ] Map the political landscape
- [ ] Identify who has influence
- [ ] Note who has concerns
- [ ] Recognise who feels overlooked
- [ ] Write your observations down for yourself
- [ ] Don't share conclusions yet
- [ ] Look for gaps in your understanding

::: warning
Don't confuse activity with progress. Sending lots of emails and scheduling lots of meetings isn't leadership — it's noise.
:::

## Weeks 9-12: Small Wins Only

Apply strict criteria to what qualifies as a "safe" first move.

### Good First Actions

- [ ] Fix an annoying process bottleneck
- [ ] Approve a tool the team has wanted
- [ ] Remove an unnecessary meeting
- [ ] Resolve a long-standing deprioritised ticket
- [ ] Make a symbolic gesture that shows you're paying attention

### Actions to Avoid

- [ ] Do NOT reorganise team structure yet
- [ ] Do NOT introduce new development processes
- [ ] Do NOT change the technology stack
- [ ] Do NOT set aggressive new targets
- [ ] Do NOT publicly criticise past decisions

::: key-takeaway
Your first 90 days aren't about proving yourself. They're about earning the right to lead meaningful change later.

## Managing Upward Expectations

Use these talking points to buy yourself time.

### For Boards and Executives

> "My priority in the first 90 days is understanding the real state of our technology and team. I'll share my initial observations at [specific date]."

### For Your Team

> "I'm not here to prove how different I am from what came before. I'm here to understand what's working, what isn't, and what you need from me."

### For Yourself

- [ ] Recognise the urge to act is often anxiety in disguise
- [ ] Remember: you were hired for your judgement, not your speed
- [ ] Demonstrating restraint is itself a signal of maturity

## Red Flags to Watch For

Before you even start — or as you discover them:

- [ ] High turnover in the role (3+ people in 2 years)
- [ ] Unrealistic timelines already set before you've assessed
- [ ] Key technical decisions made by non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] Opacity about the real state of things
- [ ] Political protection around poor performers
- [ ] Founder/CEO who micromanages technical details

::: warning
The best leaders I know have walked away from roles that looked great on paper. Sometimes restraint means acknowledging you're in an unwinnable situation.
