# Link Curation Guidelines

## Selection Criteria

For every link in The Jungle Brief, ask:

1. **Would I send this to a CTO friend unprompted?**
   - If no, don't include it
   - "Interesting" isn't enough; it must be valuable

2. **Can I add something the reader won't get elsewhere?**
   - Your context, experience, or contrarian take
   - Connection to the issue's theme
   - Warning about what to skip

3. **Is the source credible for this topic?**
   - Practitioners > pundits
   - Primary sources > aggregators
   - Recent > dated (unless timeless)

## Link Categories

### Worth Including

- Deep technical posts with real implementation details
- Contrarian takes with substance (not just hot takes)
- Case studies with specific numbers
- Tools/repos you've actually used
- Research with practical implications

### Avoid

- Hype pieces about AI/crypto/latest trend
- Listicles without depth
- Content you haven't actually read
- Self-promotional fluff
- Anything behind aggressive paywalls

## Commentary Patterns

### "Here's why this matters"
```
**[Title]** by [Author]
This connects directly to [issue theme]. The key insight: [specific thing].
```

### "Read this, skip that"
```
**[Title]** by [Author]
The first half on [topic] is excellent. Skip the second half on [other topic].
```

### "Contrarian take"
```
**[Title]** by [Author]
I disagree with [specific point], but [other aspect] is worth your time.
```

### "Timely for [context]"
```
**[Title]** by [Author]
If you're dealing with [specific situation], this is required reading.
```

## Source Rotation

Maintain variety across issues:

- Mix established voices with newcomers
- Include both technical and strategic content
- Vary formats (posts, papers, talks, repos)
- Don't over-index on any one publication

## Commentary Length

- **Minimum:** One sentence with your take
- **Optimal:** 2-3 sentences connecting to issue theme
- **Maximum:** Short paragraph if truly important

Never just list a link without context. That's what Twitter is for.

## Evergreen vs Timely

**Evergreen links:**
- Classic posts that remain relevant
- Can be included when thematically appropriate
- Always explain why you're sharing "old" content

**Timely links:**
- Connected to current events or trends
- Include within 2-3 weeks of publication
- Note if the conversation has moved on

## Link Organisation

Within the Curated Links section:

1. Lead with the strongest/most relevant link
2. Group by theme if more than 3 links
3. End with something lighter or forward-looking
4. Don't exceed 5 links (quality > quantity)
