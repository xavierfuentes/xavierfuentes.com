## Section Details

### 1. Opening Hook

The first thing subscribers see. Must earn the open.

**Format:**
- One bold statement or question
- No greeting, no preamble
- Under 140 characters ideally

**Examples:**
- "Technical debt isn't your problem. Technical debt denial is."
- "I spent this week debugging a 'simple' migration. Here's what I learned."
- "Three conversations this month, same pattern. Let me share it."

### 2. Deep Insight

The main course. One substantial idea, well-explored.

**Requirements:**
- Derived from a canonical idea in `content/ideas/`
- More personal/behind-the-scenes than the blog version
- Actionable takeaway at the end

**Structure:**
```
[Context - why this matters now]

[Core insight - the thing you're teaching]

[Example or story - make it concrete]

[Takeaway - what to do with this]
```

### 3. Template or Tool

Practical utility that justifies the subscription.

**Options:**
- Framework or mental model
- Template (decision matrix, checklist, etc.)
- Tool recommendation with configuration
- Code snippet or architecture pattern

**Format:**
- Brief context (2-3 sentences max)
- The actual thing (table, list, code block)
- How to use it (1-2 sentences)

### 4. Curated Links

3-5 links you found valuable, with your take.

**Format per link:**
```
**[Title]** by [Author]
[Your 1-2 sentence take on why it matters]
```

**Selection criteria:**
- Would you send this to a friend unprompted?
- Does it connect to the issue's theme?
- Can you add value beyond "this is good"?

### 5. Sign-off

Consistent, brief, personal.

**Keep it to:**
- One sentence transition or thought
- Your name
- Optional: One soft CTA (reply, forward)

## Formatting Rules

**Typography:**
- Use **bold** for emphasis sparingly
- Use *italics* for titles and subtle emphasis
- Avoid ALL CAPS

**Structure:**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Generous whitespace
- Headers for major sections only

**Links:**
- Inline links preferred over URLs
- No "click here" anchors
- Link text should describe destination

## Email-Specific Considerations

- Many readers on mobile - test readability
- Images: one max, prefer none
- Plain text fallback should work
- Subject line: <50 chars, hooks the insight
