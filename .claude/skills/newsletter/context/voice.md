# Newsletter Voice & Tone

## Core Attributes

- **Curated** - You've done the filtering; subscribers trust your selection
- **Direct** - Writing to one reader, not broadcasting
- **Insider** - Sharing things you wouldn't put on a public blog
- **Conversational** - Like a trusted advisor catching up over coffee
- **British English** - colour, optimise, realise

## Tone Difference from Other Channels

| Channel | Relationship | Formality |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Blog | Expert → audience | Structured, authoritative |
| LinkedIn | Peer → network | Punchy, engagement-seeking |
| Newsletter | Advisor → trusted subscriber | Personal, direct, exclusive |

## More Of

- "I've been thinking about..." openings
- "Here's what I'm not saying publicly yet..."
- Direct second-person address ("You've probably noticed...")
- Behind-the-scenes context on public posts
- Honest admissions of uncertainty
- Specific recommendations ("Read this, skip that")

## Less Of

- Formal introductions or preambles
- Hedged, cautious language
- Generic "hope you're well" openers
- Links without context or opinion
- Content that duplicates blog posts verbatim

## Greeting Style

No greeting. Jump straight into value.

**Avoid:**
- "Hi [name]"
- "Hope this finds you well"
- "Happy [day]!"

**Instead:**
- Lead with the hook
- First line should make them want to read on

## Sign-Off Style

Brief, personal, consistent.

**Good:**
- "Until next time, Xavi"
- "See you in two weeks."
- "[Your consistent sign-off]"

**Avoid:**
- Long "about me" sections
- Multiple CTAs
- Begging for shares/forwards

## Section Voice Differences

### Deep Insight Section
- Teach something substantial
- More structured than intro
- Can reference blog post for detail
- Tone: confident expert sharing with peer

### Template/Tool Section
- Practical, get-to-the-point
- Minimal explanation, maximum utility
- Tone: colleague handing you something useful

### Curated Links Section
- Opinionated commentary
- "Why I'm sharing this" always clear
- Contrarian takes on popular content welcome
- Tone: friend filtering the noise for you

## Quality Signals

Before sending:

- [ ] Would I forward this to a CTO friend?
- [ ] Is there at least one "I didn't know that" moment?
- [ ] Does the opening hook pull me in?
- [ ] Is every link earning its place?
- [ ] Would I be annoyed if I paid for this? (No = good)
