# LinkedIn Post Format

## Length Guidelines

| Metric | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| **Optimal** | 1,200-1,800 characters |
| **Hook (first line)** | Under 140 characters |
| **Maximum** | 2,000 characters (engagement drops) |
| **Minimum** | 500 characters (algorithm penalises) |

**Note:** Characters, not words. LinkedIn counts every character including spaces.

## Structure Template

```
[Hook - pattern-interrupting first line]

[2-3 short paragraphs developing the idea]

[Practical takeaway or recommendation]

[Question to prompt engagement OR soft CTA]
```

## Hook Rules

The hook must work in under 140 characters because that's what shows before "See more".

**Effective patterns:**
- Contrarian statement: "Most CTOs get this backwards."
- Personal failure: "I wasted 6 months on this mistake."
- Surprising number: "We cut deploy time by 73%."
- Direct challenge: "Your technical debt isn't the problem."

**Avoid:**
- "I'm excited to share..."
- "Here are 5 tips..."
- Starting with a question (weak hooks)
- Burying the insight

## Paragraph Structure

- Maximum 2-3 sentences per paragraph
- One idea per paragraph
- Line break between every paragraph
- White space is your friend on mobile

## Formatting Elements

**Use sparingly:**
- Bold for emphasis (LinkedIn supports **)
- Line breaks for rhythm
- Bullets only when necessary (3-5 max)

**Avoid:**
- Headers (don't render well)
- Code blocks
- Long bullet lists
- Emojis (unless that's your brand)

## Hashtags

- Maximum 3 hashtags
- Place at the end, not inline
- Use relevant, not trending
- Examples: #CTO #TechLeadership #StartupLife

## Call-to-Action Patterns

**Questions (best for engagement):**
- "What's your experience with this?"
- "Have you seen this pattern?"
- "What would you add?"

**Soft CTAs:**
- "DM me if you want the template."
- "Link to the full framework in comments."
- "More on this in my newsletter (link in bio)."

**Avoid:**
- Hard sells
- Multiple CTAs
- "Like and share if you agree"
