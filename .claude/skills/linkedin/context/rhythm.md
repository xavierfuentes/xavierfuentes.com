# LinkedIn Weekly Rhythm

## Posting Schedule

| Day | Post Type | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| **Tuesday** | Framework or template | Peak B2B engagement, provide value |
| **Wednesday** | Industry take or observation | Continue momentum, show perspective |
| **Thursday** | Personal lesson or behind-the-scenes | Build connection, share experience |

## Post Type Guidelines

### Tuesday: Framework Posts

Share actionable frameworks, templates, or methodologies.

**Examples:**
- "The 3-question test I use for every architecture decision"
- "My template for running engineering retrospectives"
- "How I structure 1:1s with my direct reports"

**Goal:** Demonstrate expertise, provide immediate value.

### Wednesday: Industry Takes

Share observations, contrarian views, or commentary on trends.

**Examples:**
- "Why most AI implementations fail (and how to avoid it)"
- "The microservices trap I see startups fall into"
- "What I learned reviewing 50 startup tech stacks"

**Goal:** Show thought leadership, spark discussion.

### Thursday: Personal Lessons

Share failures, lessons learned, behind-the-scenes stories.

**Examples:**
- "The hire I almost didn't make who became my best engineer"
- "How I nearly killed our production database"
- "What my first CTO role taught me about imposter syndrome"

**Goal:** Build trust, humanise, connect emotionally.

## Batching Workflow

All 3 posts should be created and reviewed in one session (Monday).

1. **Monday 9:30-10:00:** Review generated LinkedIn posts
2. **Edit** each post for voice and quality
3. **Schedule** for Tue/Wed/Thu mornings (8-9am UK typically best)

## Content Sources

Each LinkedIn post should derive from:
- A canonical idea draft (primary)
- A published blog post (repurposing)
- A standalone observation (occasional)

**Always link back** to the source idea via `idea_id` in frontmatter.

## Performance Signals

**Good engagement:**
- Comments with substance (not just "Great post!")
- Shares with added commentary
- DMs asking for more detail
- Profile views spike

**Adjust if:**
- Consistently low engagement on one post type
- Audience responding better to different topics
- Time of posting seems to affect reach
