# Quality Checklist

Use this checklist for content review before publishing.

## Universal Quality Checks

- [ ] **Passes "so what?" test** - Clear, consequential insight that matters
- [ ] **Specific and actionable** - Concrete advice, not vague generalities
- [ ] **Demonstrates expertise** - Shows depth without consulting speak
- [ ] **Personal insight included** - Real experience or perspective (not fabricated)
- [ ] **Avoids obvious advice** - Not generic tips anyone could write
- [ ] **Clear next step/CTA** - Reader knows what to do next
- [ ] **UK English** - colour, optimise, realise, whilst, amongst
- [ ] **London timezone** - GMT/BST, DD/MM/YYYY dates

## Blog Post Specific

- [ ] **SEO optimised** - Target keyword in title, first paragraph, headings
- [ ] **Meta description** - 150-160 characters, compelling
- [ ] **Internal links** - Cross-references to related posts
- [ ] **Lead magnet CTA** - Appropriate placement if applicable
- [ ] **Scannability** - Subheadings, bullets, short paragraphs
- [ ] **Length appropriate** - 1,500-1,800 words default, up to 2,200 for authority pieces

## LinkedIn Specific

- [ ] **Strong hook** - First line grabs attention (under 140 chars before "See more")
- [ ] **High-signal content** - No fluff, every line adds value
- [ ] **Scannable format** - Line breaks, bullets work on mobile
- [ ] **Length optimal** - 1,200-1,800 characters (not words)
- [ ] **Original content** - Not just "new blog post, link in comments"
- [ ] **Simple markdown** - Copy-pastes cleanly to LinkedIn

## Newsletter Specific

- [ ] **Complete format** - Industry round-up, deep insight, template/tool, curated reading
- [ ] **Personal commentary** - Not just links, includes perspective
- [ ] **Value-add** - More than republishing blog content
- [ ] **Clear CTAs** - Newsletter signup, lead magnets, consultation

## Case Study Rules

- [ ] **Real or clearly hypothetical** - Never fabricate and present as real
- [ ] **If real** - Explicitly mentioned in source idea, or from personal experience
- [ ] **If hypothetical** - Framed as "Consider a scenario...", "Imagine a CTO who..."
- [ ] **If neither available** - Use placeholder: `[CASE STUDY: Real example needed - theme: X]`

## Tone Checklist

**More of:**
- Specific examples and numbers
- Personal failures and lessons
- Contrarian but well-supported opinions
- Practical templates and frameworks

**Less of:**
- Abstract theorising
- Generic industry commentary
- Overly hedged, caveat-laden writing
- Corporate speak and jargon
