# First 90 Days Technical Leader Checklist

A restraint-first approach to your first three months as CTO, VP Engineering, or technical director.

## Before You Start: Red Flag Assessment

- [ ] Research the role's turnover history (3+ people in 2 years is a warning)
- [ ] Verify timelines are realistic, not already committed
- [ ] Confirm technical decisions aren't politically protected
- [ ] Ensure you're getting straight answers in interviews

---

## Weeks 1-4: Deep Listening

Your only job is to understand. Not to form conclusions. Not to identify problems.

### 1:1 Meetings

- [ ] Schedule 1:1s with every direct report
- [ ] Go at least one level deeper where feasible
- [ ] Block 60-90 minutes per conversation
- [ ] Take notes but don't share observations yet

### Shadow Mode

- [ ] Attend key meetings without contributing
- [ ] Announce explicitly: "I'm here to learn, not to judge"
- [ ] Observe team dynamics and decision-making patterns

### Documentation Review

- [ ] Read architecture documents
- [ ] Review post-mortems from the last 12 months
- [ ] Study strategy decks and roadmaps
- [ ] Browse Slack/Teams history for context

### Questions to Ask

- [ ] "What's working well here?"
- [ ] "What would you change if you could?"
- [ ] "What do I need to understand about this team's history?"
- [ ] "Walk me through a typical week for you"
- [ ] "What should I absolutely not change?"

### Questions to Avoid

- [ ] "What would you do differently?" (too leading)
- [ ] "Why do you do it this way?" (sounds like criticism)
- [ ] "Have you considered...?" (you're not here to advise yet)

## Weeks 5-8: Mapping the Landscape

Form your picture internally. Don't announce conclusions yet.

### What's Working

- [ ] Identify processes that are actually effective
- [ ] Note team strengths and capabilities
- [ ] Document successful patterns to preserve

### Pain Points

- [ ] Distinguish genuine problems from surface complaints
- [ ] Understand constraints that shaped current decisions
- [ ] Note which issues have been raised repeatedly

### Political Landscape

- [ ] Map who has influence (formal and informal)
- [ ] Identify who has concerns about your arrival
- [ ] Note who feels overlooked or undervalued

### Private Documentation

- [ ] Write down your observations (for yourself only)
- [ ] Identify gaps in your understanding
- [ ] Note questions that still need answers

## Weeks 9-12: Small Wins Only

Apply strict criteria to your first visible actions.

### Good First Action Criteria

- [ ] Visible — people notice you did something
- [ ] Quick to implement — days, not weeks
- [ ] Reversible — if it doesn't work, you can undo it
- [ ] Goodwill-building — makes someone's life easier
- [ ] Low risk — no technical debt, no political landmines

### Safe Quick Win Ideas

- [ ] Fix an annoying process bottleneck
- [ ] Approve a tool the team has wanted
- [ ] Remove an unnecessary meeting
- [ ] Resolve a long-stuck support ticket
- [ ] Clear a blocker everyone agrees on

### Actions to Avoid

- [ ] Reorganising team structure
- [ ] Introducing new development processes
- [ ] Changing the technology stack
- [ ] Setting aggressive new targets
- [ ] Publicly critiquing past decisions

## Managing Expectations

### Script for Executives/Board

"My priority in the first 90 days is understanding the real state of our technology and team. I'm conducting a thorough assessment so that when I propose changes, they'll be grounded in context and more likely to succeed."

### Script for Your Team

"I'm not here to prove how different I am from what came before. I'm here to understand what's working, what isn't, and what you need from me to be effective."

### Reminder for Yourself

The urge to act is often anxiety in disguise. You were hired for your judgement, not your speed. Demonstrating restraint is itself a signal of maturity.

## Common Mistakes Checklist

Avoid these in your first 90 days:

- [ ] Reorganising teams before understanding why they exist
- [ ] Introducing new tools in month one
- [ ] Criticising your predecessor
- [ ] Making promises about timelines or outcomes
- [ ] Confusing activity with progress

---

## 90-Day Reflection

At the end of your first quarter, ask yourself:

- [ ] Do I understand why things are the way they are?
- [ ] Have I earned legitimacy through demonstrated understanding?
- [ ] Am I in a position to lead meaningful change?
- [ ] Is this situation actually fixable, or should I reassess?

*The leaders who make the biggest impact over years are often the ones who made the smallest visible changes in their first months.*
