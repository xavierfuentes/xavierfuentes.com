## Notes

### Case Study Needs (Cross-Cutting)

Real examples needed across multiple pieces:

- **Build vs Buy**: Team that built when should've bought; migration from built to bought
- **First 90 Days**: Leadership transition that failed fast; one that succeeded through restraint
- **Stakeholder Comms**: Over-communication that transformed a board relationship
- **Tech Debt**: Team that eliminated tech debt sprints with before/after metrics

### Content Calendar Notes

- **Claude Code Framework** is timely — Claude Code adoption accelerating, publish soon
- **AI Strategy** aligns with Q1 2025 budget cycles — good January publish
- **Build vs Buy** is evergreen — can publish anytime
