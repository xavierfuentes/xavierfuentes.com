Thanks for subscribing to The Jungle Brief.

Here's the checklist I promised — a week-by-week framework for your first 90 days as a technical leader.

**[Download the First 90 Days Checklist (PDF)](https://xavierfuentes.com/content/files/2026/01/2026-01-first-90-days-checklist-1.pdf)**

## What's inside:

- **Weeks 1-4:** Deep listening — questions to ask, what to read, how to shadow effectively
- **Weeks 5-8:** Mapping the landscape — identifying what works, pain points, and politics
- **Weeks 9-12:** Small wins criteria — what makes a safe first move
- **Red flags:** Warning signs to spot before you even accept a role

Print it, tick the boxes, keep yourself honest.
