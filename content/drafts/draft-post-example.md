# This is a Draft Post

This post is located in the `content/drafts/` directory, which means it will **not** be published to Ghost automatically.

## Draft Workflow

Use the drafts folder for:

- **Work in progress** content
- **Ideas** you're not ready to publish
- **Collaborative writing** before final review
- **Scheduled content** you'll move later

## Publishing a Draft

To publish this post:

1. Move it from `content/drafts/` to `content/posts/`
2. Update the `status` to `published` if desired
3. Commit and push to the main branch

## Draft Benefits

- Keep unpublished content in version control
- Collaborate on drafts via pull requests  
- Organize ideas without cluttering your published content
- Preview and validate content before going live
