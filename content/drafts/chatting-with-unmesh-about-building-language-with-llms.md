**How CTOs Can Build a Language of Abstractions Around Large Language Models**

One of the biggest headaches for CTOs today is integrating large language models (LLMs) into existing tech stacks without turning the codebase into a mess of quick fixes and black-box calls. You’ve seen it: teams bolt on LLM APIs as magic wands, but six months later, the code is brittle, opaque, and hard to evolve.

So, how do you avoid this trap? The answer lies in deliberately *building a language of abstractions* around LLMs — a framework that turns AI-assisted development from a wild experiment into a sustainable engineering practice. I recently delved into Martin Fowler’s conversation with Unmesh Joshi on this topic, and here’s a practical breakdown that CTOs can actually use.

### Context: The Challenge of LLM Integration

Large language models are powerful but inherently fuzzy. Unlike traditional libraries with precise inputs and outputs, LLMs generate probabilistic text that varies with every prompt. This uncertainty clashes with the rigour of software engineering.

CTOs face two key challenges:

1. **Architectural Clarity:** How do you design systems where LLMs don’t become black boxes that wreak havoc on maintainability?  
2. **Team Workflow:** How do you adapt your engineering culture and processes to leverage LLMs effectively without slowing down delivery?

The first step to addressing these is to treat LLMs not as just “another API” but as components that require their own abstractions and language — much like how we treat databases or caching layers.

### Technical Analysis: What Does a Language of Abstractions Mean?

Unmesh Joshi advocates for creating a *layered abstraction* that sits between your core application logic and the LLM. This abstraction captures the intent, constraints, and expected behaviours of the LLM interactions rather than simply embedding raw prompts everywhere.

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

- **Domain-Specific Interfaces:** Instead of calling the LLM with raw prompts scattered in the code, define clear interfaces that express *what* you want in domain terms. For example, `summariseMeetingNotes(notes: string): Summary` rather than `callLLM("Summarise these notes...")`.
  
- **Prompt Templates as Code:** Store prompt templates as first-class artefacts with version control, parameterisation, and test coverage. This transforms prompt engineering from guesswork into a disciplined craft.

- **Result Validation Layers:** Implement intermediate validation and sanitisation between the LLM response and application logic to catch unexpected or malformed outputs early.

- **Composable Pipelines:** Design the interaction as a pipeline where LLM outputs feed into deterministic logic or further LLM calls, making the flow explicit and testable.

This approach aligns well with established software design principles but tailors them for the probabilistic nature of LLMs.

### Case Studies: Abstraction in Action

Consider a fintech startup I recently worked with. They wanted to use an LLM to generate customer support replies. Initially, their engineers embedded raw prompts directly into the API calls within the web app. Within weeks, inconsistencies and bugs mounted:

- Replies were sometimes off-brand or factually incorrect.  
- Prompt tweaks required risky code changes.  
- Logging and analytics on usage were non-existent.

After introducing a language of abstractions:

- They designed a `ResponseGenerator` interface with methods like `generateRefundResponse(ticket: Ticket): string`.  
- Prompt templates were stored in a separate repo with versioning and unit tests ensuring output consistency.  
- Validation rules flagged responses that didn’t conform to company policy before sending to customers.  
- They built a dashboard to monitor prompt performance and error rates, enabling data-driven prompt iteration.

The result? A 40% reduction in customer support errors related to AI replies and a 30% increase in developer velocity handling AI features.

### Strategic Implications: What CTOs Need to Consider

Building a language of abstractions around LLMs is more than a technical exercise; it’s a strategic shift.

**1. Invest in Prompt Engineering as a Core Competency**  
LLMs shift some logic from traditional programming into prompt design. CTOs must recognise prompt engineering as a first-class skill, embedding it into engineering workflows and training.

**2. Enable Cross-Functional Collaboration**  
Creating effective abstractions often requires input from product, legal, and compliance teams to bake constraints and guardrails into prompts. CTOs should facilitate these conversations early.

**3. Embrace Incremental Adoption**  
Start small. Identify discrete use cases where LLMs add clear value and build abstractions there before expanding. Avoid the “big bang” AI rollout which often leads to chaotic codebases.

**4. Measure and Monitor**  
Track LLM-related KPIs such as response accuracy, latency, and user satisfaction. Use these metrics to guide prompt iteration and abstraction refinement.

### Future Outlook: Preparing for a New AI-Driven Architecture

Looking ahead, CTOs should anticipate that AI-assisted development will become a standard part of the software stack. The abstractions we build today around large language models will evolve into modular, composable components — akin to microservices but for AI capabilities.

We may see:

- **Standardised Abstraction Frameworks:** Tools and libraries that formalise prompt templates, validation schemas, and pipelines out-of-the-box.  
- **AI-Aware IDEs:** Development environments that understand LLM abstractions and help debug AI behaviours alongside traditional code.  
- **Collaborative Prompt Repositories:** Organisational knowledge bases of provably effective prompt patterns, versioned and shared across teams.

The CTO who leads this shift will not only optimise their current engineering practices but unlock new business models enabled by AI.

### Next Steps for CTOs

If you’re ready to move beyond treating LLMs as black-box APIs, here are three immediate actions:

1. **Map Your AI Use Cases:** Identify where LLMs are used and how tightly they’re coupled to your core logic. Prioritise areas with high business impact.

2. **Define Your Abstraction Layer:** Start designing domain-specific interfaces and prompt templates. Version control and test them like code.

3. **Build Validation and Monitoring:** Implement checks on LLM outputs and gather metrics to continuously improve your AI-assisted workflows.

Have you already started building abstractions around large language models in your organisation? What challenges or wins have you experienced? Let’s discuss how to turn AI from a risky experiment into a reliable engineering asset.
