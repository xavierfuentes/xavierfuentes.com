**Team OKRs in Action: How Engineering Managers Drive Real Alignment and Execution**

Struggling to get your engineering team truly aligned with company goals? You’re not alone.

Many tech leaders wrestle with OKRs—objectives and key results—that feel like a top-down mandate rather than an energising, actionable framework. The problem? When teams don’t own their OKRs, alignment and execution falter. 

Martin Fowler’s insights on team-driven OKRs reveal a practical way out: empower teams to define their own objectives, tightly aligned with organisational strategy. Here’s how you, as an engineering manager, can turn this into a reality that boosts focus, autonomy, and delivery.

### The Problem: Misaligned OKRs Kill Momentum

I’ve seen it countless times: leadership drafts OKRs at the executive level and cascades them down. Teams receive vague directives like “Improve platform stability” or “Increase developer velocity,” but the connection to daily work is murky. 

Outcome? Teams either ignore OKRs or treat them as checkboxes, missing the strategic point altogether.

One startup I worked with had engineering OKRs that were just rephrased company goals. Result: zero ownership, poor engagement, and no measurable progress after a quarter. The bigger issue was that the company’s quarterly OKRs didn’t resonate with engineers’ realities, leading to a lack of motivation.

### The Solution Framework: Team-Driven OKRs for Real Alignment

Fowler’s approach flips the script: teams collaborate to define their own OKRs within the context of broader company goals. This isn’t bottom-up chaos; it’s strategic empowerment.

**Why does this work?**

- **Ownership:** Teams take responsibility for outcomes they helped define.
- **Relevance:** OKRs reflect the team’s actual work and challenges.
- **Transparency:** Alignment with company goals is explicit, not assumed.
- **Agility:** Teams adapt OKRs as context changes, maintaining focus.

### Step-by-Step: Implementing Team-Driven OKRs

**1. Set the Stage with Clear Organisational Objectives**

Start by communicating the company’s OKRs clearly and succinctly. For example:

- Objective: Reduce customer churn by 15% this quarter.
- Key Result: Improve onboarding flow to increase activation rate by 20%.

Make sure everyone understands the ‘why’ behind these goals.

**2. Facilitate Team Workshops for OKR Creation**

Gather your engineering team for a collaborative session. Use these questions to guide discussion:

- How can our work support reducing churn?
- What technical improvements or features will have the biggest impact?
- Which metrics can we influence directly?

Encourage the team to draft 2-3 objectives with measurable key results. For instance:

- Objective: Increase backend reliability to reduce user-facing errors by 30%.
- Key Result 1: Decrease API error rate from 5% to 3%.
- Key Result 2: Implement automated error monitoring with 95% coverage.

**3. Align and Iterate with Leadership**

Once teams propose their OKRs, review them alongside company objectives. This is a negotiation, not a diktat. Sometimes teams will add a technical objective that doesn’t map directly but supports long-term strategy (e.g., refactoring legacy code to enable faster feature development).

It’s OK to challenge and refine, but avoid rewriting OKRs for them. The goal is alignment, not control.

**4. Embed OKRs into Weekly Cadence**

Use regular stand-ups or sprint planning meetings to track progress on key results. For example, review error rates or deployment frequency metrics each week.

Encourage team members to share blockers and successes related to their OKRs. This keeps them front and centre, turning abstract goals into daily priorities.

**5. Reflect and Learn at Quarter End**

Hold a retrospective focused on OKRs. Analyse what worked, what didn’t, and why. Did your team hit their key results? If not, was it due to unrealistic goals, shifting priorities, or lack of resources?

Use these insights to improve the next cycle’s OKRs.

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

**1. Too Many OKRs**

Teams often overload themselves with objectives, diluting focus. Stick to 2-3 objectives per team per quarter, with 2-4 key results each. Clarity beats quantity.

**2. Vague or Output-Focused Key Results**

Avoid key results like “Complete feature X.” Instead, quantify impact: “Increase feature X adoption by 25%.” Focus on outcomes, not just outputs.

**3. Lack of Leadership Support**

If leadership treats team OKRs as mere reporting tools, teams won’t engage genuinely. Leaders must champion the process and respect team autonomy.

**4. Ignoring Cross-Team Dependencies**

Engineering teams rarely work in isolation. Facilitate communication between teams to align OKRs on shared goals (e.g., frontend and backend teams collaborating on performance improvements).

### Real World Example: How One Team Boosted Delivery with OKRs

At a SaaS scale-up, the engineering team struggled with slow feature releases and frequent bugs. After shifting to team-driven OKRs aligned with company goals, here’s what happened in the first quarter:

- Objective: Improve deployment frequency.
- Key Result: Increase deployments from once every two weeks to twice weekly.
- Key Result: Reduce post-deployment bugs by 40%.

The team defined actionable steps: automate testing, streamline CI/CD pipelines, and implement feature flags.

By quarter’s end, deployment frequency doubled, and bug reports dropped by 45%. More importantly, engineers felt ownership and clarity, driving sustained improvement.

### Next Steps: Start Driving Team OKRs Now

If you’re ready to move beyond top-down OKRs and unlock your team’s potential:

1. **Clarify company objectives** with your leadership team.
2. **Run a team workshop** to co-create OKRs next sprint planning.
3. **Embed OKRs into your meetings** and daily routines.
4. **Review and iterate** every quarter, focusing on learning.

OKRs are not a silver bullet, but when teams own their objectives, alignment and strategy execution improve dramatically.
