**Partner with the AI, Throw Away the Code: Rethinking LLM Metrics for CTOs**

If you’re a CTO wrestling with how to measure AI’s value, you’re not alone. Traditional metrics like AI code acceptance rates are everywhere, but they miss a crucial point: sometimes the best result from a large language model (LLM) isn’t the code it outputs—it’s the thinking it sparks. Martin Fowler’s recent article, *Partner with the AI, throw away the code*, challenges us to rethink how we assess AI’s impact. This isn’t just academic—it’s a strategic pivot every tech leader must grasp to truly harness LLMs.

**Context: The Problem with AI Code Acceptance**

AI code acceptance—the percentage of AI-generated code that developers accept without modification—is the de facto metric for LLM productivity. It sounds logical: the more code you accept, the more time you save, right?

Not quite.

Matteo Vaccari highlights a glaring hole in this approach. LLMs often produce code that no one ends up using directly. But this code isn’t worthless; it’s a catalyst for ideation, a prompt for alternative solutions, or a tool to challenge assumptions. If you only count accepted lines, you understate the AI’s true value.

For CTOs, this means the metrics you rely on might be misleading. You’re not just evaluating code snippets—you’re measuring partnership quality.

**Technical Analysis: Beyond Line-by-Line Metrics**

Let’s break down why AI code acceptance is insufficient.

Firstly, LLMs generate suggestions that may be flawed or incomplete. Developers rarely copy-paste blindly; they adapt, refactor, and reimagine. This process is inherently iterative and creative, not transactional.

Secondly, the AI’s role extends beyond code generation. It acts as an on-demand brainstorming partner, explaining concepts, suggesting architecture tweaks, or even highlighting edge cases. These interactions have no direct “code acceptance” equivalent but drive faster decision-making and higher code quality.

Fowler’s insight is that the real partnership happens when developers “throw away the code” and instead use the AI as a sounding board. The AI’s value lies in how it shapes thinking, not just what it produces verbatim.

**Case Studies: Real-World Examples**

Consider a fintech startup I recently worked with. Their CTO initially measured LLM efficiency by code acceptance rates—hovering around 35%. It seemed low, so they hesitated to invest further.

However, after reframing their approach, they tracked how often developers consulted the AI for design alternatives or debugging strategies, regardless of whether the code was reused. This “consultation frequency” metric rose to 75%, correlating with a 20% reduction in bug turnaround time.

Another example is a B2B SaaS company where developers used an LLM to generate test cases. Most generated cases were discarded, but the process uncovered overlooked edge scenarios, improving coverage by 30%. Here, discarded code wasn’t failure—it was a knowledge gain.

**Strategic Implications for CTOs**

What does this mean for your technology strategy?

1. **Redefine Success Metrics:** Move beyond raw AI code acceptance. Include qualitative measures like ideation impact, debugging guidance, and architectural insights prompted by the AI.

2. **Foster a Collaborative Culture:** Encourage teams to treat LLMs as partners, not just coding assistants. This mindset shift unlocks innovation and reduces overreliance on “perfect” AI outputs.

3. **Integrate AI into Workflow Thoughtfully:** Embed LLMs in design reviews, pair programming, and problem-solving sessions. Track how often AI interactions influence decisions, not just code lines.

4. **Measure Developer Experience:** Gather feedback on how AI changes developer confidence and creativity. These soft metrics often predict productivity gains better than code acceptance alone.

**Future Outlook: Partnering with AI, Not Just Using It**

The future of LLMs in tech leadership isn’t about automating code generation but augmenting human creativity. As models improve, the temptation will be to revert to simplistic metrics. Resist this.

Instead, develop frameworks that capture the nuanced value of AI partnerships:

- **AI Interaction Logs:** Analyse conversations between developers and LLMs for insights beyond code output.
- **Outcome-based KPIs:** Correlate AI use with product quality, release velocity, and innovation indices.
- **Continuous Learning Loops:** Use AI feedback to refine developer training and coding standards.

This approach aligns with the broader shift in technology leadership—from managing lines of code to orchestrating knowledge flows. As CTO, your role is to steer this evolution, helping your organisation realise AI’s full potential.

**Next Steps: What Can You Do Tomorrow?**

1. Stop relying solely on AI code acceptance as your LLM success metric. Start tracking how often developers consult AI for design or problem-solving input.

2. Run a small experiment: Ask your team to log AI interactions that influenced decisions, even if the generated code wasn’t used.

3. Host a workshop to shift your team’s mindset toward “AI as a partner”. Share examples where discarded AI code led to better solutions.

4. Build dashboards that combine quantitative and qualitative AI usage data to inform strategic decisions.

To wrap up—how are you currently measuring the value of AI in your engineering teams? Could redefining success metrics unlock hidden potential? I’d love to hear your experiences or challenges with integrating LLMs beyond code acceptance. Let’s start the conversation.
