Struggling to build the right abstractions with LLMs? You’re not alone.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed how we think about programming abstractions, but they also introduce fresh complexity. As CTOs, we must both leverage their power and navigate the architectural trade-offs. Drawing on insights from Martin Fowler’s recent conversation with Unmesh Joshi, here’s a practical framework for embedding LLMs into your abstraction layers — without losing control or clarity.

**Context: Why abstractions matter with LLMs**

Abstractions are the backbone of scalable software. They hide complexity, enable reuse, and guide team communication. Traditionally, we craft abstractions by identifying patterns in code and domain concepts. LLMs, by contrast, offer a new kind of abstraction: they encode vast amounts of language and knowledge, enabling us to generate code, documentation, or even entire APIs on demand.

But this isn’t a simple swap. Unlike classic abstractions, LLMs are probabilistic and opaque. They don’t neatly fit into your existing type systems or interfaces. The challenge is to build a “language” of abstractions around LLMs— a reliable, explicit set of tools and protocols that your teams can trust.

**Technical Analysis: Building a language of abstractions with LLMs**

Unmesh Joshi discusses how LLMs can accelerate the creation of abstractions by automating pattern recognition and code generation. However, this requires a disciplined approach:

1. **Define explicit intents and boundaries.** Don’t treat the LLM as a magic box. Instead, specify clear input-output contracts, for example: “Given a user query, generate SQL that meets these constraints.” This reduces uncertainty and improves reliability.

2. **Compose abstractions hierarchically.** Use LLMs to implement low-level functions, then build stable interfaces on top. For instance, an LLM might generate boilerplate code, but your system should wrap that in well-tested modules exposing predictable APIs.

3. **Version and monitor LLM outputs.** Because LLM responses vary, track which model versions produce which code snippets. Automated tests and monitoring guard against regressions or unexpected behaviour.

This approach treats LLMs as a new layer in the abstraction stack, subject to the same rigour we apply elsewhere.

**Case Studies: Real-world examples**

Consider a fintech startup I advised last year. They integrated GPT-style models to auto-generate data transformation scripts from business analyst inputs. Initial trials were promising, but early versions produced inconsistent SQL queries, causing data errors.

By introducing a strict interface layer—where LLM-generated code was wrapped in validation routines and sandboxed execution—they reduced errors by 75% within three months. They also tagged every generated script with model version metadata, enabling rapid rollback when issues arose.

Another example comes from a SaaS company building natural language interfaces for customer support. They used LLMs to generate response templates but layered human-in-the-loop verification to maintain quality. This hybrid abstraction preserved speed while ensuring reliability.

**Strategic implications for CTOs**

The key takeaway: LLMs don’t replace abstraction design; they reshape it. CTOs must:

- **Invest in abstraction languages around LLMs.** This means creating clear, composable interfaces that encapsulate LLM behaviour.
  
- **Prioritise observability and testing.** LLM-generated code is probabilistic; continuous validation is essential to maintain system integrity.

- **Balance automation with human oversight.** Embrace hybrid models where LLMs accelerate development but humans safeguard correctness.

Ignoring these steps risks brittle architectures where LLMs introduce unpredictable failures or maintenance burdens.

---

**Future outlook: Preparing for the next wave**

As LLMs evolve, so will their role in programming. I expect:

- **More specialised LLMs trained on domain-specific abstractions,** reducing noise and improving precision.

- **Formalisation of LLM interaction protocols** that blend natural and formal languages, offering tighter integration into software stacks.

- **Tooling to visualise and debug LLM-generated abstractions,** making these layers more transparent to engineering teams.

CTOs who start investing in these abstraction “languages” today will unlock faster innovation cycles and more resilient architectures tomorrow.

**Next steps: How to start**

1. **Map your current abstraction layers** and identify where LLMs might add value.

2. **Define explicit contracts** for LLM inputs and outputs.

3. **Build wrappers and validation around LLM-generated artefacts.**

4. **Implement monitoring and version control** on LLM usage.

5. **Pilot hybrid human-LLM workflows** to balance speed and quality.

This isn’t a theoretical shift—it’s a pragmatic evolution in programming. How are you refining your abstraction language to harness LLMs without sacrificing control? Let’s discuss in the comments.
