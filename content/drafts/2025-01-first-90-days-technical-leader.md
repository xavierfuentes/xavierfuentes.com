Picture this: you're the fourth person to hold the role in eighteen months. You know it's a red flag. You take the job anyway.

You tell yourself the story every ambitious leader tells: "I can fix this." The title is good. The offer is generous. Pride and pressure make a dangerous combination.

Seven months later, you're gone.

I've seen this pattern play out dozens of times — and I've lived versions of it myself. The pressure to prove yourself fast is real. Boards want visible progress. Founders expect transformation. And your own ego whispers that you're different, that you'll succeed where others failed. That voice is the most dangerous one of all.

Here's the problem: most "first 90 days" advice is optimised for consultants, not incoming leaders. And it's the number one reason technical leadership transitions fail.

## Why the Standard Playbook Fails

The classic 90-day framework — assess, plan, execute — sounds logical. It's what MBAs teach. It's what boards expect. It's also designed for people who parachute in, deliver recommendations, and leave before living with the consequences.

When you're joining as a permanent leader, the dynamics are fundamentally different. You're not here to assess and advise. You're here to lead a team through change whilst maintaining their trust, productivity, and morale. That requires something the consulting model ignores entirely: **legitimacy**.

Legitimacy isn't granted by your title. It's earned through demonstrated understanding of context, respect for what exists, and thoughtful action that shows you've done the work to understand why things are the way they are.

New leaders who arrive with transformation agendas often fail not because their ideas are wrong, but because they haven't earned the right to implement them. They reorganise teams before understanding why those teams exist. They introduce new tools before learning what problems the current tools were solving. They criticise decisions made under constraints they never experienced.

The result? Resistance. Resentment. And months of cleanup whilst the organisation recovers from well-intentioned but premature change.

## The Restraint-First 90 Days

What if, instead of racing to make your mark, you deliberately slowed down? What if the best thing you could do in your first 90 days was listen more than you speak, observe more than you act, and resist the urge to prove how different you are from your predecessor?

This is the restraint-first approach. It's not passive — it's strategic. You're building the context and trust that will make your eventual changes more effective and more durable.

### Weeks 1-4: Deep Listening

Your only job in the first month is to understand. Not to form conclusions. Not to identify problems. Just to absorb.

- **Schedule 1:1s with every direct report**, and go at least one level deeper if feasible
- **Shadow key meetings without contributing** — announce this explicitly: "I'm here to learn, not to judge"
- **Read everything**: architecture documents, post-mortems, strategy decks, Slack history
- **Ask open questions**: "What's working well? What would you change? What do I need to understand about this team's history?"

The temptation will be enormous to share your observations. Resist it. The moment you start offering opinions, people stop telling you the truth and start performing for the new boss.

### Weeks 5-8: Mapping the Landscape

Now you can start forming a picture. But keep it internal. This is about building your own understanding, not announcing conclusions.

- Identify what's actually working (there's always more than you initially think)
- Note genuine pain points vs. surface complaints
- Understand the constraints that shaped current decisions — budget, timing, talent, history
- Map the political landscape: who has influence, who has concerns, who feels overlooked

Write this down for yourself. Don't share it yet. The act of articulating your observations will reveal gaps in your understanding.

### Weeks 9-12: Small Wins Only

Only now should you consider visible action. But apply strict criteria to what qualifies as a "safe" first move.

**A good first action is:**

- **Visible** — people notice you did something
- **Quick to implement** — days, not weeks
- **Reversible** — if it doesn't work, you can undo it
- **Goodwill-building** — makes someone's life easier
- **Low risk** — no technical debt, no political landmines

**Examples of good first actions:** fixing an annoying process bottleneck, approving a tool the team has wanted, removing an unnecessary meeting, resolving a long-standing support ticket that's been deprioritised.

**Bad first actions:** reorganising team structure, introducing new development processes, changing the technology stack, setting aggressive new targets, publicly critiquing past decisions.

## When Restraint Isn't Enough

Sometimes the problem isn't how you lead — it's whether you should have joined at all.

Consider a common scenario: a new technology leader joins a well-funded startup. They inherit a small team, an expensive outsourced agency handling core systems, and an architecture that's grown far more complex than the product requires. The founder wants the product live in six months.

The new leader wants to practice restraint. They really do. But they're being asked to solve the problem *now*. So they do what feels strategic: focus on team-building first, scaling the engineering department significantly. Senior engineers, principal engineers, squad leads. The plan is to bring development in-house.

It's the right strategy. But they execute it without fully understanding the politics. There are dynamics between stakeholders they haven't mapped. Key relationships and dependencies they don't see. They're building a team to solve a technical problem, but the real problems aren't technical.

Within months, they're out.

The mistake wasn't their first 90 days. It was ignoring what those days revealed. Four leaders in eighteen months isn't a challenge to overcome — it's a symptom of something deeper. Sometimes the restraint you need isn't in how you lead. It's in whether you join at all.

## Managing Upward Expectations

The hardest part of the restraint-first approach is explaining it to stakeholders who expect immediate visible change.

**For boards and executives:** "My priority in the first 90 days is understanding the real state of our technology and team. I'm conducting a thorough assessment so that when I propose changes, they'll be grounded in context and more likely to succeed. I'll share my initial observations at [specific date]."

**For your team:** "I'm not here to prove how different I am from what came before. I'm here to understand what's working, what isn't, and what you need from me to be effective. My job in these first months is to listen."

**For yourself:** The urge to act is often anxiety in disguise. New leaders feel like they need to justify their hire. But you were hired for your judgement, not your speed. Demonstrating restraint is itself a signal of maturity.

## Practical Implementation

### The Listening Tour

Block 60-90 minutes for each 1:1. Start with context questions, not problem-solving:

- "Walk me through a typical week for you"
- "What's the best thing about working here? What's the most frustrating?"
- "What do you wish previous leadership had understood?"
- "What should I absolutely not change?"

### Questions to Avoid Early

- "What would you do differently?" — too leading, invites performance
- "Why do you do it this way?" — sounds like criticism
- "Have you considered...?" — you're not here to advise yet

### Identifying Safe Quick Wins

**Look for:**
- Blockers that everyone agrees are blockers
- Approvals that have been stuck in limbo
- Small quality-of-life improvements
- Symbolic gestures that signal you're paying attention

**Avoid anything that:**
- Requires significant engineering effort
- Changes reporting structures
- Sets precedents you might regret
- Could be interpreted as criticism of individuals

## Before You Even Start: Reading the Red Flags

Sometimes the most important restraint happens before day one.

**Warning signs to take seriously:**

- **High turnover in the role** — if you're the third or fourth person in two years, ask why
- **Unrealistic timelines already set** — "we need this live in six months" before you've assessed anything
- **Key technical decisions made by non-technical stakeholders** — especially if they're politically protected
- **Opacity about the real state of things** — if you can't get straight answers in interviews, you won't get them later

The best leaders I know have walked away from roles that looked great on paper. They understood that no amount of skill can fix an environment that doesn't want to be fixed.

If you're reading this and already in the role — it's not too late to reassess. Sometimes restraint means acknowledging you're in an unwinnable situation and planning your exit, not your transformation.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Reorganising teams too early.** Team structures reflect history, relationships, and hard-won compromises. Changing them without understanding why they exist creates chaos and resentment.

**Introducing new tools or processes in month one.** Even beneficial changes create disruption. Wait until you understand the current tools' strengths and the team's capacity for change.

**Criticising your predecessor.** Even if the criticism is deserved, it signals that you'll do the same to others. It also ignores the constraints they operated under that you may not yet understand.

**Making promises about timelines or outcomes.** You don't have enough information yet. Underpromise until you understand the landscape.

**Confusing activity with progress.** Sending lots of emails, scheduling lots of meetings, and proposing lots of initiatives feels productive. It's often just noise. Real progress in the first 90 days looks like deepening understanding, not generating activity.

## The Counterintuitive Truth

The leaders who make the biggest impact over years are often the ones who made the smallest visible changes in their first months. They arrive with humility. They listen with genuine curiosity. They respect what exists whilst forming their own views. And when they finally act, they do so with legitimacy — earned through demonstrated understanding, not assumed from title.

Your first 90 days aren't about proving yourself. They're about earning the right to lead meaningful change later.
