# First 90 Days as a Technical Leader

## Problem

New technical leaders feel immense pressure to prove their worth immediately. Boards, founders, and teams expect visible change — new processes, new tools, new direction. The conventional wisdom (and most "first 90 days" content) reinforces this: arrive, assess, and drive transformation quickly.

But most leadership transitions fail not from inaction, but from premature action. New leaders break working systems they didn't understand, alienate teams by dismissing existing context, and create churn that takes months to recover from. The real risk in the first 90 days isn't moving too slowly — it's moving too fast without understanding what you're changing and why.

## Angle

- Everyone focuses on making their mark quickly — the real job in the first 90 days is listening, understanding, and not breaking what already works
- Restraint is a leadership skill; most first-90-days advice ignores this
- Learn the business inside out before proposing structural changes
- Only handle immediate quick wins with no long-term impact (low-risk, high-goodwill actions)
- The goal is to build trust and context, not to demonstrate how different you are from your predecessor
- Early visible action often signals insecurity, not competence

## Rough Outline

1. **Hook**: The pressure to prove yourself fast is real — and it's the number one reason technical leadership transitions fail. What if the best thing you can do in your first 90 days is deliberately do less?

2. **Context**: Why the standard "first 90 days" playbook (assess, plan, execute) is optimised for consultants, not incoming leaders. The difference between external assessment and earning the right to drive change.

3. **Framework**: The Restraint-First 90 Days
   - Week 1-4: Deep listening (1:1s, shadowing, reading everything)
   - Week 5-8: Mapping what works and what doesn't (without announcing conclusions)
   - Week 9-12: Small wins only — visible, quick, reversible, and goodwill-building
   - Criteria for "safe" first actions vs. actions that require more context
   - How to manage upward expectations whilst taking this approach

4. **Case Study**: Examples of leadership transitions that failed from moving too fast (and one that succeeded through restraint). Anonymised but specific.

5. **Implementation**: Practical steps for the first 90 days
   - The listening tour structure
   - Questions to ask (and not ask) in early 1:1s
   - How to identify quick wins that don't create technical debt or political landmines
   - Managing your own impatience and the urge to prove yourself
   - Communicating your approach to stakeholders who expect immediate change

6. **Pitfalls**: What to avoid
   - Reorganising teams before you understand why they're structured that way
   - Introducing new tools or processes in the first month
   - Criticising your predecessor (even if justified)
   - Making promises about timelines or outcomes before you have context
   - Confusing activity with progress

## Canonical Notes

- Target personas: new CTOs (first-time or new company), engineering managers promoted or hired into new teams
- This directly supports the "First 90 Days as CTO Checklist" lead magnet from the content strategy
- Contrarian positioning: most advice says "move fast, make your mark" — this says "slow down, earn the right"
- Personal experience angle: include specific examples from transitions that went well (and badly)
- Could pair well with a LinkedIn series: "3 things I wish I hadn't done in my first 90 days as CTO"
- Seasonality: particularly relevant in Q1 (new year, new roles) and post-funding rounds

## Canonical Draft

The pressure to prove yourself fast is real. Boards want visible progress. Founders expect a fresh perspective. Your new team is watching to see what kind of leader you are. And every "first 90 days" article you've read tells you the same thing: assess quickly, plan boldly, execute decisively.

Here's the problem: that advice is optimised for consultants, not incoming leaders. And it's the number one reason technical leadership transitions fail.

### Why the Standard Playbook Fails

The classic 90-day framework — assess, plan, execute — sounds logical. It's what MBAs teach. It's what boards expect. It's also designed for people who parachute in, deliver recommendations, and leave before living with the consequences.

When you're joining as a permanent leader, the dynamics are fundamentally different. You're not here to assess and advise. You're here to lead a team through change whilst maintaining their trust, productivity, and morale. That requires something the consulting model ignores entirely: legitimacy.

Legitimacy isn't granted by your title. It's earned through demonstrated understanding of context, respect for what exists, and thoughtful action that shows you've done the work to understand why things are the way they are.

New leaders who arrive with transformation agendas often fail not because their ideas are wrong, but because they haven't earned the right to implement them. They reorganise teams before understanding why those teams exist. They introduce new tools before learning what problems the current tools were solving. They criticise decisions made under constraints they never experienced.

The result? Resistance. Resentment. And months of cleanup whilst the organisation recovers from well-intentioned but premature change.

### The Restraint-First 90 Days

What if, instead of racing to make your mark, you deliberately slowed down? What if the best thing you could do in your first 90 days was listen more than you speak, observe more than you act, and resist the urge to prove how different you are from your predecessor?

This is the restraint-first approach. It's not passive — it's strategic. You're building the context and trust that will make your eventual changes more effective and more durable.

**Weeks 1-4: Deep Listening**

Your only job in the first month is to understand. Not to form conclusions. Not to identify problems. Just to absorb.

- Schedule 1:1s with every direct report, and go at least one level deeper if feasible
- Shadow key meetings without contributing (announce this explicitly — "I'm here to learn, not to judge")
- Read everything: architecture documents, post-mortems, strategy decks, Slack history
- Ask open questions: "What's working well? What would you change? What do I need to understand about this team's history?"

The temptation will be enormous to share your observations. Resist it. The moment you start offering opinions, people stop telling you the truth and start performing for the new boss.

**Weeks 5-8: Mapping the Landscape**

Now you can start forming a picture. But keep it internal. This is about building your own understanding, not announcing conclusions.

- Identify what's actually working (there's always more than you initially think)
- Note genuine pain points vs. surface complaints
- Understand the constraints that shaped current decisions (budget, timing, talent, history)
- Map the political landscape: who has influence, who has concerns, who feels overlooked

Write this down for yourself. Don't share it yet. The act of articulating your observations will reveal gaps in your understanding.

**Weeks 9-12: Small Wins Only**

Only now should you consider visible action. But apply strict criteria to what qualifies as a "safe" first move.

A good first action is:
- Visible (people notice you did something)
- Quick to implement (days, not weeks)
- Reversible if it doesn't work
- Goodwill-building (makes someone's life easier)
- Low risk (no technical debt, no political landmines)

Examples: fixing an annoying process bottleneck, approving a tool the team has wanted, removing an unnecessary meeting, resolving a long-standing support ticket that's been deprioritised.

Bad first actions: reorganising team structure, introducing new development processes, changing the technology stack, setting aggressive new targets, publicly critiquing past decisions.

### When Things Go Wrong: A Hypothetical

Consider a scenario where a new engineering director joins a Series B fintech. They're experienced, sharp, and full of ideas. Within the first month, they identify what they see as obvious problems: outdated deployment practices, unclear ownership boundaries, and a monolith that "should" be broken into services.

They propose a reorganisation in week six. Three teams become five. Reporting lines shift. A platform team is created from scratch. A migration to microservices kicks off.

Six months later, the migration is behind schedule. The new platform team is understaffed and overwhelmed. Two senior engineers have left, citing unclear direction. The original monolith is now a hybrid mess — neither the old system nor the new architecture, just confused complexity.

The diagnosis wasn't wrong. The deployment practices were outdated. Ownership was unclear. The monolith had problems. But the leader hadn't understood why things were that way. The monolith existed because the team had explicitly chosen to avoid distributed systems complexity given their small size. The blurry ownership was a feature, not a bug — it allowed a small team to swarm on urgent issues. The "outdated" deployment process was actually quite reliable and well-understood by everyone.

The new leader's changes were reasonable in isolation but catastrophic in context. They'd moved too fast to understand what they were breaking.

### Managing Upward Expectations

The hardest part of the restraint-first approach is explaining it to stakeholders who expect immediate visible change. Here's how to frame it:

**For boards and executives:** "My priority in the first 90 days is understanding the real state of our technology and team. I'm conducting a thorough assessment so that when I propose changes, they'll be grounded in context and more likely to succeed. I'll share my initial observations at [specific date]."

**For your team:** "I'm not here to prove how different I am from what came before. I'm here to understand what's working, what isn't, and what you need from me to be effective. My job in these first months is to listen."

**For yourself:** The urge to act is often anxiety in disguise. New leaders feel like they need to justify their hire. But you were hired for your judgement, not your speed. Demonstrating restraint is itself a signal of maturity.

### Practical Implementation

**The Listening Tour Structure**

Block 60-90 minutes for each 1:1. Start with context questions, not problem-solving:

- "Walk me through a typical week for you"
- "What's the best thing about working here? What's the most frustrating?"
- "What do you wish previous leadership had understood?"
- "What should I absolutely not change?"

**Questions to Avoid Early**

- "What would you do differently?" (too leading, invites performance)
- "Why do you do it this way?" (sounds like criticism)
- "Have you considered...?" (you're not here to advise yet)

**Identifying Safe Quick Wins**

Look for:
- Blockers that everyone agrees are blockers
- Approvals that have been stuck in limbo
- Small quality-of-life improvements
- Symbolic gestures that signal you're paying attention

Avoid anything that:
- Requires significant engineering effort
- Changes reporting structures
- Sets precedents you might regret
- Could be interpreted as criticism of individuals

### What to Avoid

**Reorganising teams too early.** Team structures reflect history, relationships, and hard-won compromises. Changing them without understanding why they exist creates chaos and resentment.

**Introducing new tools or processes in month one.** Even beneficial changes create disruption. Wait until you understand the current tools' strengths and the team's capacity for change.

**Criticising your predecessor.** Even if the criticism is deserved, it signals that you'll do the same to others. It also ignores the constraints they operated under that you may not yet understand.

**Making promises about timelines or outcomes.** You don't have enough information yet. Underpromise until you understand the landscape.

**Confusing activity with progress.** Sending lots of emails, scheduling lots of meetings, and proposing lots of initiatives feels productive. It's often just noise. Real progress in the first 90 days looks like deepening understanding, not generating activity.

### The Counterintuitive Truth

The leaders who make the biggest impact over years are often the ones who made the smallest visible changes in their first months. They arrive with humility. They listen with genuine curiosity. They respect what exists whilst forming their own views. And when they finally act, they do so with legitimacy — earned through demonstrated understanding, not assumed from title.

Your first 90 days aren't about proving yourself. They're about earning the right to lead meaningful change later.
