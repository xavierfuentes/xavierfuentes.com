# AI Strategy for Leaders Who Don't Code

## Problem

Engineering leaders and CTOs are drowning in AI noise. Every vendor promises revolution, every engineer wants to experiment, but executives lack the strategic framework to make informed decisions. They don't have time to learn LangChain or build RAG pipelines - nor should they.

Current AI education falls into two camps:
- **Technical courses** (KodeKloud, DeepLearning.AI) - excellent for engineers, useless for decision-makers who need strategic, not implementation, knowledge
- **Executive fluff** - buzzword-heavy presentations with no practical frameworks for actual decision-making

Nothing exists in between: strategic AI literacy for leaders who need to evaluate, approve, and govern AI initiatives without writing code themselves.

## Angle

- "You don't need to build it. You need to lead teams who do."
- The missing layer is strategic AI literacy - not coding skills, not vague trend-watching
- Most AI vendor pitches are designed to confuse; leaders need a bullshit filter
- Build vs. buy decisions in AI are fundamentally different from traditional software
- AI theatre (demos, POCs that never ship) vs. genuine capability is the critical distinction
- European tech leaders are making these decisions right now, often without the right framework

## Rough Outline

1. **Hook**: The impossible position - expected to make AI strategy decisions without understanding the technology, surrounded by people who either oversimplify or overcomplicate
2. **Context**: Why traditional executive education fails for AI (it's not like learning to evaluate SaaS vendors or cloud migrations)
3. **Framework**: The Strategic AI Literacy Model
   - Evaluating AI vendors without getting sold snake oil
   - The right questions to ask your engineering team
   - Understanding cost structures and hidden risks (compute, data, maintenance, hallucination liability)
   - Build vs. buy decision matrix for AI specifically
   - Spotting AI theatre vs. genuine capability
4. **Case Study**: Real examples of AI decisions gone wrong (and right) - anonymised client/industry stories
5. **Implementation**: How to develop this literacy in yourself and your leadership team
6. **Pitfalls**: Common executive AI mistakes (chasing shiny demos, underestimating data requirements, overestimating timeline)
7. **Next Steps**: CTA to gated course / newsletter for deeper frameworks

## Content Funnel

### LinkedIn Series (3 posts)

**Post 1 - The Pain Point**
- Hook: "Your board wants an AI strategy. Your engineers want to experiment. Vendors are circling. And you're expected to make decisions about technology you've never built."
- Angle: Validate the impossible position, establish empathy and authority

**Post 2 - The Framework Tease**
- Hook: Specific example of AI theatre vs. real capability
- Angle: Demonstrate the kind of strategic thinking that separates informed leaders from those getting sold snake oil

**Post 3 - The Contrarian Take**
- Hook: "The best AI strategy might be no AI strategy (yet)"
- Angle: When to wait, when to move - the decision framework in brief

### Blog Article (Pillar Piece)
- Full framework with practical checklists
- Downloadable templates (vendor evaluation, build vs. buy matrix)
- SEO-optimised for "ai strategy for executives" and related terms
- Clear CTA to gated course

### Gated Course (Lead Magnet)
- 4-5 modules, video + templates
- Requires email signup (newsletter growth)
- Positions for coaching/fractional CTO follow-up

## Canonical Notes

- Target persona: European CTO/VP Engineering, 50-500 person company, Series A-C, being asked to "do something with AI"
- Competitors in this space: mostly consultancies selling expensive engagements, not educational content
- Differentiator: practical frameworks from someone who's been the technical decision-maker, not a consultant observing from outside
- Timing: Q1 2025 budget cycles mean AI strategy conversations happening now
- Consider: could this become a signature framework/methodology with a name?
- Research needed: specific vendor red flags, anonymised case studies, current AI cost benchmarks
