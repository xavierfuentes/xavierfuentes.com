# AI Strategy for Leaders Who Don't Code

## Problem

Engineering leaders and CTOs are drowning in AI noise. Every vendor promises revolution, every engineer wants to experiment, but executives lack the strategic framework to make informed decisions. They don't have time to learn LangChain or build RAG pipelines - nor should they.

Current AI education falls into two camps:
- **Technical courses** (KodeKloud, DeepLearning.AI) - excellent for engineers, useless for decision-makers who need strategic, not implementation, knowledge
- **Executive fluff** - buzzword-heavy presentations with no practical frameworks for actual decision-making

Nothing exists in between: strategic AI literacy for leaders who need to evaluate, approve, and govern AI initiatives without writing code themselves.

## Angle

- "You don't need to build it. You need to lead teams who do."
- The missing layer is strategic AI literacy - not coding skills, not vague trend-watching
- Most AI vendor pitches are designed to confuse; leaders need a bullshit filter
- Build vs. buy decisions in AI are fundamentally different from traditional software
- AI theatre (demos, POCs that never ship) vs. genuine capability is the critical distinction
- European tech leaders are making these decisions right now, often without the right framework

## Rough Outline

1. **Hook**: The impossible position - expected to make AI strategy decisions without understanding the technology, surrounded by people who either oversimplify or overcomplicate
2. **Context**: Why traditional executive education fails for AI (it's not like learning to evaluate SaaS vendors or cloud migrations)
3. **Framework**: The Strategic AI Literacy Model
   - Evaluating AI vendors without getting sold snake oil
   - The right questions to ask your engineering team
   - Understanding cost structures and hidden risks (compute, data, maintenance, hallucination liability)
   - Build vs. buy decision matrix for AI specifically
   - Spotting AI theatre vs. genuine capability
4. **Case Study**: Real examples of AI decisions gone wrong (and right) - anonymised client/industry stories
5. **Implementation**: How to develop this literacy in yourself and your leadership team
6. **Pitfalls**: Common executive AI mistakes (chasing shiny demos, underestimating data requirements, overestimating timeline)
7. **Next Steps**: CTA to gated course / newsletter for deeper frameworks

## Editorial Notes

### Voice & Angle Decisions
- Best hook of the batch: "Welcome to the impossible position of the modern technology leader"
- "Strategic AI literacy" framing is strong and differentiated
- "Take the vendor's cost estimate and multiply by three" — specific, memorable, quotable
- "AI theatre" concept is excellent — consider making this a signature term

### Case Study Opportunities
- [OPTIONAL] Brief vendor horror story if available — current example (line 168) is short enough
- Consider: anonymised examples of AI decisions gone wrong/right

### Feedback Log
- 30/12/2024: Graded A. Nearly ready — light polish only
- 30/12/2024: Case study brief and acceptable as hypothetical
- 30/12/2024: Could lean harder into contrarian opinions
- 30/12/2024: CTA (course sign-up) is soft — ensure course exists before publishing

## Canonical Notes

- Target persona: European CTO/VP Engineering, 50-500 person company, Series A-C, being asked to "do something with AI"
- Competitors in this space: mostly consultancies selling expensive engagements, not educational content
- Differentiator: practical frameworks from someone who's been the technical decision-maker, not a consultant observing from outside
- Timing: Q1 2025 budget cycles mean AI strategy conversations happening now
- Consider: could this become a signature framework/methodology with a name?
- Research needed: specific vendor red flags, anonymised case studies, current AI cost benchmarks

## Canonical Draft

Your board wants an AI strategy. Your engineers are itching to experiment with LLMs. Vendors are circling with demos that would make a Silicon Valley writer blush. And somehow, you're expected to make million-pound decisions about technology you've never built and don't fully understand.

Welcome to the impossible position of the modern technology leader.

### Why Traditional Executive Education Fails for AI

If you're a CTO or VP Engineering at a Series A-C company, you've likely noticed a peculiar gap in available resources. On one side, there are technical courses teaching you to build RAG pipelines and fine-tune models — brilliant if you were going to do the work yourself, which you're not. On the other side, executive briefings serve up buzzword soup with zero practical frameworks for actual decision-making.

This gap exists because AI isn't like previous technology waves. When cloud computing arrived, executives could evaluate it like any infrastructure decision: costs, migration paths, vendor lock-in. SaaS procurement followed familiar patterns. But AI is different. The technology changes monthly. The vendors speak a language designed to obscure rather than clarify. And the gap between a compelling demo and a production system is often measured in years and millions of pounds.

What's missing is strategic AI literacy — the ability to evaluate, approve, and govern AI initiatives without writing code yourself. You don't need to build it. You need to lead teams who do.

### The Strategic AI Literacy Framework

Strategic AI literacy isn't about understanding transformer architectures. It's about developing the judgment to make good decisions when surrounded by hype, uncertainty, and competing interests.

**1. The Vendor Evaluation Filter**

Every AI vendor presentation follows the same script: impressive demo, vague architecture diagram, hockey-stick projections. Here's how to cut through it:

- **Ask about failure modes.** A mature AI product has well-understood failure cases. "It just works" is a red flag.
- **Request production metrics, not demo metrics.** Accuracy on curated examples means nothing. What's the performance on your actual data?
- **Probe the data requirements.** "We'll need access to your customer data" often means "we're going to train our model on your competitive advantage."
- **Understand the integration reality.** That two-week POC will become a six-month integration project. Every time.

**2. Questions for Your Engineering Team**

Your engineers want to experiment. That's healthy. But experimentation without strategy burns budget and morale. Ask:

- **What specific business problem are we solving?** "Exploring AI capabilities" is not a business problem.
- **What's the MVP, and what happens if it doesn't work?** AI projects have higher failure rates than traditional software.
- **Where does the training data come from?** Data is the bottleneck, not algorithms.
- **What's the ongoing cost structure?** Compute costs compound. A successful pilot can become an unsustainable production system.
- **How will we measure success?** If they can't define it, they can't achieve it.

**3. Understanding the True Cost Structure**

AI costs are deceptive. The visible costs — API calls, compute, licensing — are often the smallest component. The hidden costs include:

- **Data preparation**: 60-80% of most AI projects is spent cleaning and preparing data.
- **Maintenance burden**: Models degrade. They need retraining, monitoring, and updating.
- **Integration complexity**: AI systems rarely slot neatly into existing architectures.
- **Liability exposure**: When your AI hallucinates and gives a customer bad advice, who's responsible?

A useful heuristic: take the vendor's cost estimate and multiply by three. Take their timeline and double it. You'll still probably be optimistic.

**4. The Build vs. Buy Matrix for AI**

Traditional build vs. buy frameworks don't translate well to AI. Here's what matters:

| Factor | Build | Buy |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Data is your competitive advantage | Yes | No |
| You need the capability in 3 months | No | Maybe |
| Model customisation is critical | Yes | No |
| You have ML engineering capacity | Yes | No |
| The use case is commoditised | No | Yes |

The uncomfortable truth: most companies should buy for commodity use cases and build only where AI directly differentiates their product. The reverse — building everything "for control" — typically leads to half-finished internal tools that never match vendor quality.

**5. Spotting AI Theatre**

AI theatre is the gap between impressive demos and production reality. It's endemic in the current market. Warning signs:

- **The demo uses cherry-picked examples.** Ask to run your own test cases.
- **There's no discussion of edge cases or failure modes.** Every AI system has them.
- **The timeline magically fits your budget cycle.** AI doesn't care about Q4.
- **"We'll handle the data"** means they haven't thought about data.
- **The team can't explain the limitations clearly.** If they don't know the limits, they haven't tested them.

Consider a scenario where a Series B fintech is evaluating an AI vendor for fraud detection. The demo is spectacular: 99.2% accuracy, real-time processing, seamless integration. Six months later, the same company is still trying to get the system above 85% accuracy on their actual transaction data, which turns out to be messier, more varied, and fundamentally different from the training set the vendor used. The demo was real. The production system was always going to be different.

### How to Develop Strategic AI Literacy

You can't outsource strategic judgment. Here's how to build it:

**1. Allocate learning time ruthlessly.** One hour per week reading technical content that's slightly beyond your comfort zone. Not vendor whitepapers — actual technical analysis. Sources like The Pragmatic Engineer, a16z's AI newsletter, or Simon Willison's blog hit the right level for technical decision-makers.

**2. Build a translation layer in your team.** Identify the engineer who can explain technical concepts without condescension and make them your AI strategy partner. Their job isn't to make decisions for you — it's to ensure you have accurate information.

**3. Run small experiments before big commitments.** A four-week proof of concept with a clear hypothesis is worth more than months of vendor evaluation. Fail fast, learn cheaply.

**4. Talk to companies who've implemented, not evaluated.** Vendors will give you references. Ask those references: what was harder than expected? What would you do differently? What did it actually cost?

**5. Accept uncertainty.** The honest answer to "should we invest in AI?" is often "we don't know yet." That uncertainty is information. Build small, learn, iterate.

### Common Mistakes

**Chasing the demo.** That ChatGPT-style interface the vendor showed is not your production system. It's marketing.

**Underestimating data requirements.** AI is hungry. Your data is probably messier than you think, and cleaning it will take longer than building the model.

**Overestimating internal capability.** Your excellent software engineers may not be excellent ML engineers. These are different skills.

**Moving too fast.** "We need an AI strategy by next board meeting" produces strategy theatre, not strategy.

**Moving too slow.** AI capability is compounding. Companies that start learning now will have significant advantages in three years. Waiting for "clarity" means waiting forever.

**Treating AI as IT's problem.** AI strategy is business strategy. Technology execution is IT's problem. Conflating them leads to expensive technical projects that solve no business problems.

### What To Do Next

Strategic AI literacy is a skill. Skills develop with practice. Here's where to start:

1. **Audit your current AI exposure.** What AI-adjacent projects are running in your organisation? What's the status of each? Most leaders are surprised by what they find.

2. **Identify one low-risk experiment.** Pick a problem where AI might help, failure is cheap, and learning is valuable regardless of outcome.

3. **Block learning time.** An hour a week. Protect it. Use it.

4. **Talk to peers, not vendors.** Other CTOs dealing with similar decisions are worth more than any sales engineer.

You don't need to become an AI engineer. You need to become the leader who can distinguish AI theatre from genuine capability, ask the right questions, and make decisions under uncertainty. That's the job. It always has been.
