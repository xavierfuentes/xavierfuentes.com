notes: Never too much comms. Managing up is almost as important as managing down. Avoid being chased for updates and results. Establish a good list of OKRs and KPIs with every stakeholder and keep the updates flowing. It's better to be told to stop communicating than being chased — the former earns you autonomy, the latter micromanagement.

# Stakeholder Communication and Managing Up

## Problem

Technical leaders often underestimate how critical upward communication is to their success and autonomy. Many engineering managers and CTOs focus heavily on managing their teams whilst neglecting the equally important work of keeping stakeholders informed. The result: they get chased for updates, lose credibility, and ultimately find themselves micromanaged — the very outcome they were trying to avoid by keeping their heads down and "just delivering."

## Angle

- Managing up is almost as important as managing down — yet most technical leaders spend 90% of their energy on the latter
- It's far better to be told "you're communicating too much" than to be chased for updates — one earns autonomy, the other invites micromanagement
- Proactive communication isn't about managing perception; it's about building the trust that lets you do your best work
- Establish clear OKRs and KPIs with every stakeholder upfront, then keep updates flowing consistently — silence breeds anxiety

## Rough Outline

1. **Hook**: The paradox of the high-performing technical leader who still gets micromanaged — not because they're failing, but because they're invisible. Contrast two scenarios: being asked to dial back updates vs. being chased for a status report.

2. **Context**: Why stakeholder communication matters more in technical leadership than we admit. The asymmetry of information between technical and non-technical stakeholders. How silence gets interpreted as trouble, even when things are going well.

3. **Framework**: The Proactive Communication Framework
   - Identify all stakeholders and their information needs
   - Establish shared OKRs/KPIs at the outset
   - Set cadence and format for updates (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
   - Create templates for consistent reporting
   - Build in early warning systems for blockers

4. **Case Study**: A real-world example of how over-communication transformed a relationship with a sceptical board member or anxious founder. Before/after comparison of trust levels and autonomy granted.

5. **Implementation**: Step-by-step guide to setting up your stakeholder communication system
   - Stakeholder mapping exercise
   - The "first 30 days" conversation template
   - Weekly update template (5 bullet points, 2 minutes to read)
   - How to communicate bad news proactively
   - Tools and automation options

6. **Pitfalls**: Common mistakes when managing up
   - Over-promising to avoid difficult conversations
   - Hiding problems until they become crises
   - Assuming technical colleagues "get it" without updates
   - Treating communication as overhead rather than investment
   - Inconsistent cadence that erodes trust

7. **Next Steps**: Practical actions for the reader
   - Audit your current stakeholder communication (who, what, when)
   - Schedule "expectations alignment" conversations with key stakeholders
   - Implement a weekly update routine this week
   - Download the Engineering Team Health Check Scorecard to assess your communication gaps

## Editorial Notes

### Voice & Angle Decisions
- Killer hook: "the problem isn't your delivery. It's your silence." — DO NOT CHANGE
- Asymmetry insight is genuinely useful — core of the piece
- Practical templates (5-bullet weekly update) are high-value

### Case Study Opportunities

### Feedback Log
- 30/12/2024: Graded A-. Case study (lines 154-160 in idea) is hypothetical — mark or replace with real
- 30/12/2024: Could be punchier in implementation section
- 30/12/2024: Add personal voice to the close — "I've been that leader who earned 'just flag the big stuff'"

## Canonical Draft

You're a high-performing engineering leader. Your team ships reliably. Technical debt is under control. Yet somehow, you're still being micromanaged. Every board meeting feels like an interrogation. Your CEO asks for "quick updates" that consume hours. The founder who hired you now treats you like a junior project manager.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **the problem isn't your delivery. It's your silence.**

Most technical leaders spend 90% of their energy managing down—their teams, their systems, their backlogs. They neglect the equally critical work of managing up. The result is predictable: they get chased for updates, lose credibility, and invite the very micromanagement they were trying to avoid by keeping their heads down.

There's a simple test for whether you're getting this right. Would you rather hear "You're sending too many updates—I trust you, just flag the big stuff" or "Can you send me a status update on where we are with the platform migration?"

The first earns you autonomy. The second invites scrutiny. Most technical leaders experience the second without realising they're creating the conditions for it.

### Why Silence Gets Interpreted as Trouble

Non-technical stakeholders—boards, founders, investors—operate in an information vacuum when it comes to engineering. They can't walk past the development floor and sense whether things are on track. They don't read pull requests or sprint retrospectives. All they have is what you tell them.

In the absence of information, people fill the void with anxiety. A week without updates becomes "I wonder if there's a problem they're not telling me about." Two weeks becomes "There's definitely a problem." A month of silence means "We need to bring in someone to figure out what's really going on."

This is the asymmetry of technical leadership: you know exactly what's happening, so silence feels fine. They know nothing, so silence feels ominous. The engineer's default—"I'll surface issues when they arise"—reads to stakeholders as "I'll tell you when it's too late to do anything about it."

The best technical leaders I've observed understand this asymmetry viscerally. They communicate proactively not because they enjoy status meetings, but because they've learned that proactive communication is the price of autonomy.

### The Proactive Communication Framework

Getting stakeholder communication right isn't about sending more emails. It's about building a system that keeps the right people informed at the right cadence, with minimal overhead. Here's how to set it up.

**1. Map Your Stakeholders and Their Needs**

Start by listing everyone who has a legitimate interest in your team's work. This typically includes:

- **CEO/Founder**: Strategic progress, major blockers, resource needs
- **Board members**: High-level metrics, milestone progress, risk exposure
- **Product counterparts**: Delivery timelines, technical constraints, dependencies
- **Peer engineering leaders**: Shared resources, architectural decisions, cross-team dependencies
- **Finance**: Budget adherence, headcount planning, vendor costs

For each stakeholder, answer: What do they actually need to know? How often? In what format? A board member doesn't need sprint-level detail. A product partner might.

**2. Establish Shared OKRs and KPIs Upfront**

Before you can communicate progress, you need agreement on what progress looks like. In your first conversations with each stakeholder, establish:

- What outcomes we're trying to achieve (not just outputs)
- How we'll measure success
- What "on track" and "off track" look like in practice
- How and when we'll review these metrics together

This conversation takes an hour but saves dozens of hours of miscommunication later. It also surfaces misaligned expectations before they become conflicts.

**3. Set Cadence and Format for Each Audience**

Different stakeholders need different rhythms:

| Stakeholder | Cadence | Format |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| CEO | Weekly | 5-bullet email update |
| Board | Monthly | Dashboard with narrative |
| Product | Daily/Weekly | Stand-up or Slack channel |
| Peers | Bi-weekly | 1:1 or shared doc |

The key is consistency. An irregular update schedule is almost worse than no updates—it signals that communication is an afterthought, not a priority.

**4. Create Templates for Consistent Reporting**

A simple weekly update template removes friction and ensures nothing falls through the cracks:

- **Wins**: 1-2 things that shipped or went well
- **Progress**: Key metrics or milestones
- **Blockers**: What's slowing us down (if anything)
- **Decisions needed**: What I need from you this week
- **Looking ahead**: What's coming next week

This takes five minutes to write and two minutes to read. If your updates take longer than that, you're overcomplicating them.

**5. Build Early Warning Systems**

The updates that matter most are the ones nobody wants to send: we're going to miss the deadline. The project is in trouble. I made a mistake.

Build a personal system for flagging these early. My rule: if I'm worried about something for more than 24 hours, I surface it. Not with drama—just with facts, context, and proposed next steps. Stakeholders can handle bad news. What they can't handle is surprise bad news that's been brewing for weeks.

### How Over-Communication Transforms Relationships

Consider a scenario where a CTO joins a Series B startup with a sceptical board. The previous technical leader was let go after a platform migration ran six months late—not because the engineering was poor, but because the board only learned about the delays at the eleventh hour. Trust was gone.

The new CTO takes a different approach. In the first board meeting, she presents a simple dashboard: four metrics that matter, updated weekly, with red/amber/green status. She commits to sending a one-paragraph email every Friday—here's what happened, here's what's coming. No spin, no jargon.

For the first two months, the board chair reads every email carefully, asks follow-up questions, requests additional detail. By month three, the emails get shorter acknowledgements. By month six, the chair says: "You don't need to copy me on these anymore. Just flag anything I should know about."

That's the goal. Not to report less, but to report consistently enough that stakeholders stop worrying.

### Implementation: Your First 30 Days

Here's how to set up your stakeholder communication system from scratch:

**Week 1: Stakeholder Mapping**
- List all stakeholders who depend on your team's work
- For each, identify: what they need, how often, and their preferred format
- Book "expectations alignment" conversations with the three most important

**Week 2: Expectations Conversations**
- Ask each stakeholder: "What does success look like for my function in your eyes?"
- Agree on 3-5 metrics or milestones you'll track together
- Establish update cadence and format

**Week 3: Template Creation**
- Build your weekly update template (5 bullets, 2 minutes to read)
- Set a recurring calendar block to write it (Friday afternoons work well)
- Send your first updates—even if they feel too simple

**Week 4: Refinement**
- Ask for feedback: "Is this useful? What's missing?"
- Adjust format and cadence based on responses
- Document your system so it survives your absence

### Common Mistakes When Managing Up

**Over-promising to avoid difficult conversations.** It's tempting to say "yes, we can hit that deadline" to end an uncomfortable meeting. Resist. A realistic "no" now is infinitely better than a surprised "no" later.

**Hiding problems until they become crises.** Every problem looks smaller when surfaced early. The migration delay is a three-week conversation in month one, or a three-month crisis in month four. Choose wisely.

**Assuming technical colleagues "get it" without updates.** Your CTO peers, product partners, and platform team leads need updates too. They may understand the technical context, but they don't have visibility into your team's priorities and progress.

**Treating communication as overhead rather than investment.** Thirty minutes per week on stakeholder updates pays for itself in hours not spent in "emergency" status meetings, rebuilding trust, or managing perception damage.

**Inconsistent cadence that erodes trust.** Missing one weekly update is fine. Missing three in a row signals that communication isn't a priority—and invites the scrutiny you were trying to avoid.

### Next Steps

Managing up isn't about perception management or politics. It's about building the trust that lets you do your best work without constant oversight. Start this week:

1. **Audit your current communication**: Who are you updating? How often? What are you missing?
2. **Book expectations conversations**: Schedule 30 minutes with your top three stakeholders to align on metrics and cadence
3. **Send your first weekly update**: Even a rough version beats no version. Start the habit now
4. **Download the Engineering Team Health Check Scorecard** to assess where your team's communication gaps might be creating invisible friction

The goal isn't to communicate more—it's to communicate consistently enough that stakeholders stop worrying about what they don't know. Get this right, and you'll hear the words every technical leader wants to hear: "I trust you. Just flag the big stuff."
