  Founders often think they need a full-time CTO too early. This piece argues for
  a fractional CTO model in early stages, with concrete decision criteria and
  frameworks they can use.

# Working title
Why your startup doesn't need a full-time CTO (yet)

## Problem
Early-stage founders feel pressure (from investors, peers, ego) to hire a full-time
CTO as soon as engineering hits 3–10 people. They over-index on titles rather than
the actual work that needs doing.

## Angle
- Contrarian but grounded: argue that a full-time CTO is often premature.
- Show how a fractional CTO can cover strategy, architecture, and hiring without
  locking in a heavyweight exec too early.
- Make it concrete: decision frameworks, thresholds, examples.

## Rough outline
1. Hook: "You probably don't need a full-time CTO yet"
2. Context: where the pressure comes from (investors, signalling, ego)
3. Framework: decision criteria for when a full-time CTO *is* justified
4. Case study: anonymised example from your experience
5. Implementation: how a fractional CTO engagement could look (scope, cadence)
6. Pitfalls: bad patterns (title inflation, over-hiring, under-scoping)
7. Next steps: questions founders should ask before hiring a CTO

## Canonical notes
- Tie directly into fractional CTO positioning on the site.
- Keep it practical: include checklists and questions they can literally copy.
