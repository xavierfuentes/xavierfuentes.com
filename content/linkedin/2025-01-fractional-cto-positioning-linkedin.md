## Post 1 – Hot take: You probably don’t need a full-time CTO yet

**Hook**
Most startups between 3–20 engineers don’t need a full-time CTO.
They need clear technical decisions, not a big title on the org chart.

**Body**
If any of these feel familiar, you’re at high risk of over-hiring:
- Investors keep asking “who’s the CTO?” so you feel you *must* have one.
- Your job ad lists every possible responsibility: IC, people manager, architect, product partner.
- You’re copying org charts from companies 10x your size.

At this stage, you rarely have a *CTO-shaped* problem. You have:
- A decision problem (what to build, on what stack, with which trade-offs).
- A hiring problem (who to bring in next, and in what order).
- A communication problem (how to explain those decisions to non-technical people).

A good fractional CTO plus strong senior ICs can cover all of that without locking you into an expensive, hard-to-undo executive hire.

**CTA**
If you’re wrestling with “do we really need a CTO now?”, DM me “FRACTIONAL” and I’ll send you the decision checklist I use with founders.

## Post 2 – A simple framework for deciding when you *do* need a full-time CTO

**Hook**
“Should we hire a full-time CTO?” is the wrong question.
“What *job* do we need done right now?” is a better one.

**Body**
Here’s a lightweight framework I use with founders:

Check three dimensions:
- **Product complexity** – Are you in deep infra/ML/regulatory territory, or a fairly standard SaaS/product?
- **Team size** – Are you at 3–5 engineers, 6–15, or 16+?
- **Risk surface** – Are bad technical decisions existential or just annoying?

Rules of thumb:
- 3–10 engineers, moderate complexity, manageable risk → senior IC + fractional CTO.
- 10–20 engineers, rising complexity, more stakeholders → start planning for a full-time CTO.
- 20+ engineers, high complexity, real regulatory/commercial risk → you’re probably late.

The point isn’t the exact numbers. It’s forcing a real conversation about **what work actually needs doing**, rather than hiring a title because “that’s what startups do”.

**CTA**
If you want the full framework with examples, comment “FRAMEWORK” and I’ll share the breakdown.

## Post 3 – The hidden cost of hiring the wrong CTO too early

**Hook**
The most expensive CTO mistake isn’t waiting too long to hire.
It’s hiring one too early into the wrong job.

**Body**
Patterns I see over and over:
- A brilliant IC is promoted to “CTO” but still expected to ship code 4–5 days a week.
- The team assumes “we have a CTO now” so nobody else takes ownership of technical decisions.
- The founder silently expects this person to fix product, engineering, hiring, and strategy… at once.

Result:
- Slower decisions.
- Frustrated engineers.
- A burned-out “CTO” who was never set up to succeed.

A fractional CTO model lets you:
- Buy the senior thinking **before** you over-rotate the org chart.
- Trial what you actually need from a future full-time CTO.
- Avoid the painful “we hired the wrong exec” conversation six months later.

**CTA**
If this feels uncomfortably familiar, send me a note. I’m happy to sanity-check whether you’re solving a CTO problem or something else entirely.
