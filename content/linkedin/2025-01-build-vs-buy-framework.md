# LinkedIn Projections: Build vs Buy Decision Framework

## Post 1: The Hook (Wednesday)

"We could build this in a weekend."

Those six words have cost startups more money than any failed marketing campaign.

I've watched this film too many times:

→ Team decides to build something that already exists
→ Estimate: 2 weeks
→ Reality: 6 months minimum
→ Then maintenance forever
→ Customer features rot in the backlog

I've seen teams build custom CMS platforms because "Ghost gives users too many options."

I've seen data engineers recreate Snowflake because "it's too expensive."

Both projects are still limping along years later. Passed from team to team. Nobody wants to own them. Nobody wants to kill them either.

The instinct to build runs deep. We're engineers. Building is what we do.

But left unchecked, it leads to teams spending 60-70% of capacity on commodity infrastructure instead of features that differentiate the business.

The question isn't "can we build this?"

It's "should we?"

I put together a decision framework for exactly this. Link in comments.

## Post 2: The Framework (Tuesday)

Build vs Buy: 5 questions in order.

Exit as soon as you hit a clear answer.

**1. Is this core to what customers pay you for?**
No → Buy.

**2. Will building create sustainable competitive advantage?**
No → Buy.

**3. What stage is your business?**
Pre-PMF → Bias heavily to buy. Speed beats ownership.
Growth/Scale → Build selectively.

**4. Do you have expertise to build AND maintain this?**
No → Buy.

**5. Would buying get you to market faster?**
Yes, and still validating → Buy now, revisit in 12 months.

The default is "buy" unless you can clearly articulate the competitive advantage from building.

Build deliberately.
Buy ruthlessly.

I wrote up the full framework with real examples (including when building WAS the right call). Link in comments.

## Post 3: The Story (Thursday)

At Nando's, I kept pushing to build our own Kitchen Display System.

Everyone thought I was mad. "Just buy Aloha KDS. Or QSR Automations."

We'd tried both. Across dozens of restaurants. Nothing came close to what we needed.

Here's why building was right:

The "way of cooking" is one of Nando's secret sauces. The choreography of flame-grilled chicken. The timing. The quality checks.

This wasn't peripheral infrastructure.
It was core to the customer experience.

Off-the-shelf options couldn't capture how Nando's nandocas actually work in the kitchen.

Building meant:
→ Display exactly what we wanted
→ Measure what mattered
→ Iterate without waiting for a vendor

The project took ~2 years to reach production. It shipped in Australian restaurants after I'd moved on.

But it met all the criteria:
✓ Core to value proposition
✓ Genuinely unique requirements
✓ We had expertise to maintain it

Most build decisions don't pass this test.

But when they do? Build without hesitation.

The trick is knowing which is which. I wrote up a simple 5-question framework for exactly this decision. Link in comments.

## Post 4: The Warning (Optional - Friday)

The sunk cost trap in build vs buy decisions:

I watched a team build a "global data platform" because Snowflake was too expensive.

Logic looked sound on a spreadsheet:
→ High licensing costs
→ Growing data volumes
→ Capable engineers

Years later, it's still limping along.

Minimal resources. Less enthusiasm. Each time a new team inherits it, they discover more gaps. More debt.

The cumulative investment has long exceeded what Snowflake would have cost.

And it still doesn't match Snowflake's capabilities.

Nobody ever said "we need to stop."

The sunk cost fallacy is powerful.

Once you've invested six months, killing it feels like admitting failure.

So you invest another six.
Then another.

The lesson:

If you're building something that competes with a well-funded specialist vendor—and it's not your core business—you're probably making a mistake.

Ask: "What's the best use of the next engineer-year?"

Not: "What have we already invested?"
