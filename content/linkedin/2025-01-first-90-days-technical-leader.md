# LinkedIn Projections: First 90 Days as Technical Leader

## Post 1: The Contrarian Take (Wednesday)

Most "first 90 days" advice will get you fired.

Here's why: it's optimised for consultants, not incoming leaders.

Consultants parachute in, deliver recommendations, and leave before living with the consequences.

When you're joining as a permanent leader, the dynamics are different. You're not here to assess and advise. You're here to lead a team through change whilst maintaining their trust.

That requires something the consulting model ignores: legitimacy.

Legitimacy isn't granted by your title. It's earned through:

→ Demonstrated understanding of context
→ Respect for what already exists
→ Thoughtful action that shows you've done the work

New leaders who arrive with transformation agendas often fail not because their ideas are wrong.

They fail because they haven't earned the right to implement them.

The best thing you can do in your first 90 days? Deliberately slow down.

I put together a First 90 Days Checklist with the exact framework I recommend to new CTOs and engineering leaders.

Drop a comment or DM me "90 DAYS" and I'll send it over.

## Post 2: The Framework (Tuesday)

The Restraint-First 90 Days:

Most new leaders try to prove themselves fast. Here's a different approach.

**Weeks 1-4: Deep Listening**

Your only job is to understand. Not to form conclusions. Just absorb.

• 1:1s with every direct report (go one level deeper if you can)
• Shadow meetings without contributing
• Read everything: architecture docs, post-mortems, Slack history
• Ask open questions, resist sharing your observations

**Weeks 5-8: Mapping the Landscape**

Now you can form a picture. Keep it internal.

• What's actually working (there's always more than you think)
• Genuine pain points vs surface complaints
• Constraints that shaped current decisions
• Political landscape: who has influence, who feels overlooked

**Weeks 9-12: Small Wins Only**

Apply strict criteria:

✓ Visible (people notice)
✓ Quick (days, not weeks)
✓ Reversible (if it fails, undo it)
✓ Goodwill-building (makes someone's life easier)
✓ Low risk (no technical debt, no political landmines)

Bad first moves: reorgs, new processes, stack changes, aggressive targets.

I created a printable checklist with all of this broken down week by week.

Comment "CHECKLIST" and I'll send it to you.

## Post 3: The Red Flags (Thursday)

4 red flags to spot before you accept a technical leadership role:

**1. High turnover in the role**

You're the 3rd or 4th person in two years? That's not a challenge to overcome. It's a symptom.

Ask why. Really dig. If the answers are vague, run.

**2. Unrealistic timelines already set**

"We need this live in six months" — before you've even assessed the situation.

You're being hired to fail.

**3. Key technical decisions made by non-technical stakeholders**

Especially if those people are politically protected.

You'll spend more time navigating politics than building.

**4. Opacity about the real state of things**

If you can't get straight answers in interviews, you won't get them later.

The best leaders I know have walked away from roles that looked great on paper.

They understood: no amount of skill can fix an environment that doesn't want to be fixed.

Sometimes the restraint you need isn't in how you lead. It's in whether you join at all.
