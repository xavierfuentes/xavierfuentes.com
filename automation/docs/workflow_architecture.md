# Content Automation Workflow Architecture
## Complete System Design with Multi-Agent AI Enhancement

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06
**Version:** 3.0 (Consolidated multi-agent system)

---

## Executive Summary

This architecture defines the complete automation system for XavierFuentes.com content creation, from RSS research through multi-channel publishing (blog, LinkedIn, newsletter) with AI-enhanced quality control.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-channel content strategy:** Separate paths for blog, LinkedIn, newsletter
- **Multi-agent AI system:** Writer → CTO Reviewer → Editor → Brand Voice chain
- **Voice profile consistency:** Maintains authentic writing style across all AI-generated content
- **Content atomization:** Extract 5-10 derivative pieces from each blog post
- **Performance feedback loop:** Continuous learning and optimization
- **Automated quality gates:** 8 validation checks before publishing

**Expected Impact:**
- **Editing time:** Reduced from 2-3 hours to 30-45 minutes per piece (-60-70%)
- **Content quality:** Technical accuracy +40%, engagement +25%
- **Content volume:** 3-5x output from same research input
- **Voice consistency:** 90%+ match with authentic style
- **Monthly targets:** 2 blogs, 10-11 LinkedIn original, 2 LinkedIn promos, 4 newsletters

---

## Core Problem Statement

The content strategy requires:
- **Blog:** 2 posts/month (1,500-2,500 words)
- **LinkedIn:** 12-13 posts/month (200-800 words)
  - 10-11 original standalone posts
  - 2 blog promotion posts
- **Newsletter:** 4 digests/month (weekly compilation)

**Previous Architecture Issue:** Trying to derive LinkedIn content from blog posts created a bottleneck. Blog output (2/month) cannot feed LinkedIn needs (12-13/month).

**Solution:** Separate content creation paths for each channel, all fed by the same research queue, enhanced with multi-agent AI quality control.

## Phase 0: Voice Profile Setup (One-Time)

### Purpose
Create a "digital fingerprint" of your authentic writing voice to ensure all AI-generated content sounds genuinely like you.

### Workflow: `voice_profile_extractor.json` (Run Once)

**Input Required:**
- 10-15 of your best published articles
- 5-10 LinkedIn posts with high engagement
- 2-3 newsletter issues
- Any personal writing samples

**Process:**
1. Extract writing patterns across all samples
2. Identify vocabulary preferences (UK English, technical terms, signature phrases)
3. Analyze structural patterns (sentence/paragraph length, rhetorical devices)
4. Create voice profile JSON
5. Validate with test generations (iterate until 8+ authenticity rating)

**Output:** `/automation/config/voice_profile.json`

```json
{
  "vocabulary": {
    "prefer": ["whilst", "optimise", "realise", "organisation"],
    "avoid": ["synergy", "leverage (verb)", "disrupt"],
    "signature_phrases": [
      "Here's what nobody tells you about...",
      "I learned this the hard way..."
    ]
  },
  "structure": {
    "avg_sentence_length": 18,
    "avg_paragraph_length": 4,
    "opening_style": ["provocative_question", "bold_statement", "failure_story"]
  },
  "rhetorical": {
    "uses_personal_failures": "frequently",
    "includes_specific_numbers": "always",
    "contrarian_angle": "often",
    "humour_style": "dry_british"
  },
  "tone": {
    "formality": "professional_but_personal",
    "confidence": "assertive_not_arrogant",
    "directness": "high",
    "technical_depth": "high_with_accessible_explanation"
  }
}
```

**Frequency:** Run once, update quarterly based on performance feedback

---

## Phase 1: Research & Curation

### Workflow: `rss_to_research.json` ✅ Exists
- **Trigger:** Hourly
- **Process:**
  1. Fetch articles from configured RSS feeds
  2. Filter for relevance to content pillars
  3. Score each article (relevance, actionability, depth)
  4. Store in Notion Content Pipeline database
  5. Status: "Research"
- **Output:** Notion pages in "Research" status

### Workflow: `weekly_content_selection.json` ✅ Exists
- **Trigger:** Sunday 9 AM
- **Process:**
  1. Fetch all "Research" status items
  2. Archive stale content (>45 days, low scores)
  3. Calculate weekly scores with pillar balancing
  4. Auto-select top candidates (4-5 items)
  5. Mark as "Should Process"
  6. Send summary email
- **Output:** Curated list ready for content route selection

---

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent Content Creation

### Workflow: `content_creation_enhanced.json`

Four specialized AI agents working in sequence, each with validation checkpoints.

#### Agent 1: Writer Agent (GPT-4o)
**Role:** Initial content generation with creative exploration

**Input:**
- Research item from Notion
- Content Route (blog/linkedin/newsletter)
- Voice Profile JSON
- Content Pillar requirements
- Word count target

**Output:** Draft v1.0 (70% ready, creativity prioritized)

---

#### Agent 2: CTO Reviewer Agent (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
**Role:** Technical accuracy, depth, and strategic insight validation

**Why Claude:** Superior reasoning, technical depth, identifies logical gaps

**Review Criteria:**
1. Technical accuracy (critical issues flagged)
2. Strategic depth (beyond surface-level advice)
3. Practical applicability (can readers implement this?)
4. Credibility markers (specific examples, numbers, trade-offs)
5. Gaps & improvements (missing CTO perspective)

**Output:** Draft v2.0 (85% ready, technically accurate)

**Checkpoint:** If technical_accuracy_score < 7, flag for manual review

---

#### Agent 3: Editor Agent (GPT-4o)
**Role:** Clarity, flow, grammar, UK English compliance

**Editing Priorities:**
1. UK English compliance (non-negotiable)
2. Clarity & flow (remove jargon, vary sentence length)
3. Grammar & style (fix errors, remove passive voice)
4. Voice consistency (maintain personal tone)
5. Readability (Flesch-Kincaid 60+, avg sentence ~18 words)

**Output:** Draft v3.0 (95% ready, polished)

---

#### Agent 4: Brand Voice Validator (GPT-4o)
**Role:** Final check that content authentically sounds like Xavier

**Validation Checks:**
1. Vocabulary match (UK English, signature phrases)
2. Structural match (sentence/paragraph length)
3. Rhetorical match (personal stories, specific numbers)
4. Tone match (professional but personal, direct)

**Output:** Draft v4.0 (98% ready, voice-validated)

**Checkpoint:** If voice_authenticity_score < 8, flag for manual review

## Phase 2.5: Automated Quality Gates

### Workflow: `quality_gates_validator.json`

**8 Validation Checks:**

1. **UK English** (critical): No American spellings
2. **Readability** (moderate): Flesch-Kincaid ≥ 60
3. **Specific Example** (moderate): Contains numbers and examples
4. **Call to Action** (minor): Includes engagement prompt
5. **SEO Keywords** (minor): 1-2% keyword density
6. **Buzzword Check** (moderate): No corporate jargon
7. **Personal Insight** (moderate): Includes personal experience
8. **Word Count** (critical): Within ±10% of target

**Decision Logic:**
- **Critical failures (1+):** Block commit, send back to agent
- **Moderate failures (3+):** Flag for review but allow commit
- **Minor failures (5+):** Log warning, proceed
- **All pass:** Proceed to GitHub commit

## Future Enhancements (Phase 6+)

### Context Enhancement System
Before content generation, ask Xavier 3 quick questions (2 min investment):
1. Personal experience (any specific failure or success?)
2. Contrarian angle (what would most CTOs get wrong?)
3. Practical reality check (hidden complexity nobody talks about?)

**Value add:** 10x authenticity

### Smart Content Routing
AI-suggested Content Route based on:
- Article characteristics
- Historical performance
- Current pipeline needs
- Content pillar balance

Still allows manual override

### A/B Testing System
Generate 2-3 variations of same piece:
- Version A: Tactical focus
- Version B: Strategic focus
- Version C: Story focus

Track performance, learn what works

### Continuous Voice Learning
After each high-performing piece:
1. Extract successful patterns
2. Update voice profile automatically
3. A/B test new patterns vs old
4. Keep what works

**Result:** Voice profile evolves to match your best work

### Predictive Content Scoring
Train model on historical data to predict engagement rate and traffic estimate. Use to prioritize high-predicted-value content in queue.
